"Hi, Todd So good to hear from you again. Thanks for getting back to me. I'm sorry I've not been able to reply sooner.  I know how to use the menu in the way you've shown, to select a certain size range overall for ALL THE DIFFERENT images displayed. What I'm talking about specifically is the ability to get multiple size choices for the SAME image., and it's one of the image searching features that puts Bing head and shoulders above Google, IMHO.  I'm an almost daily contributor to  Fark.com. I search the internet for funny pictures in a variety of topics and post them there. I prefer pictures in a sort of ""Goldilocks"" range: nothing that's too big, and nothing that's too small. This is where this now-broken feature comes in handy.  To illustrate further, and expand on the images I posted above, please compare this image with the first image I posted:    If you look carefully, you'll notice that the underlined image size in the first image above is grayed out, while the one in this image is brighter, indicating an active link. As I mentioned, if I time it right, I can click on that link if I do it within a second after refreshing the page, after which point the link grays out and goes dead.  That link leads to:    A page with multiple copies of the same image, all from different sources, with the larger sizes arrayed at the top of the page, ranging all the way down ...    ... to the smaller sizes at the bottom of the page. Yeah, I can still access it, but I have to be quick and click on that link in the first second after refreshing the page, and it doesn't always work. This is NOT the way it is supposed to work, and not the way it has worked for as long as I've been using Bing.  Additionally, the second picture I posted in my original post, there are three boxes marked ""Large"", ""Medium"" and ""Small"", plus a fourth link that says ""Search all sizes"". These links are still highlighted like the function, but they always lead to a dead page that says ""We did not find any results for ..."", and these are pictures that ALWAYS have other results.  No amount of quick-fingered clicking will make these links function like they should.  This has been an incredibly useful feature to me, and it's now broken. It doesn't work in Firefox or Internet Explorer on my computer, and I checked a friend's computer and it doesn't work in IE or Google Chrome on theirs. I think if you tried it on yours that you'd find it doesn't work like it's supposed to in Edge either.  This is a function I've been using for quite a long time, and I can say without hesitation that it is broken, and the fault is with Bing, not with my computer, as I've checked another computer and got the same results.

I'm using Skype V 7.56(776) on MacBook Pro Retina 15 mid 2015 - 2.8ghz i7 16GB RAM 1600 Mhz DDR3  I did as you suggested and was able to change my profile picture this morning - so thanks very much.  A few notes in passing:  Clicking on my profile picture as you suggest does nothing on Mac version. But DOUBLE clicking it (or clicking on the inset camera icon) does open a dialogue box where one can find a new picture. I did this and it worked - but it never actually gave me the text or written option as you list at point 2 - IE 'change picture' - I think it just assumes that's what you want to do..... anyway, like I say, it worked. So thanks again.  What still does NOT work - and really, it's at this point only for those that don't have the app installed - is I still can not change my picture through a browser. I log in to Skype.com and go to Profile and Personal Information and I can change my name and address here - but not my image. Who knows why!? - Anyway.

"Hello Jonathan,  Welcome to Bing Community!  The results that you receive when you search the Internet with the Bing search box depend on how you construct your search query. Since you would like to search for file types, you should identify first which specific file type you are looking for. For images, you can use .gif, .jpg, .jpeg or .png file extensions as search query. If you are in search for documents, the extensions are .doc, .pdf or .xls.  For example, you would like to search for images of dogs in jpeg format. Type these as search queries either in the Web or Images tab: +dogs .jpeg Search result URL: http://www.bing.com/images/search?q=%2bdogs+.jpeg&FORM=RCIR  You will notice that the search results will show images of dogs in .jpeg format only. However, if you would like to include some results in .jpg format, just type in, dogs .jpeg as search queries.

"First, I want to say thank you for taking the time to respond to my dilemma here.  I followed all of your instructions, and the app is still not working. I should mention that it was a very clean uninstall, and there was no leftover registry data or folders. I searched for them as you instructed, but there was nothing there, even with hidden folders unhidden.   I also checked the Bing Bar (I don't use it, but I figured I'd check it) and it has the same problem as Bing Desktop: it's visible, but none of the pulldown menus or icons do anything except become highlighted after I press them.   I doubt this is it, but do these app require Facebook integration? I recently deleted my Facebook account, and then went through the process of disconnecting Facebook from my Microsoft account so I would stop getting emails about reconnecting the Facebook account to my Microsoft one. I don't remember if it was the same day, but it was around the same time that Bing Desktop stopped working.

"I'm trying to create a Kiosk-type presentation and I want additional info to pop up next to the mouse cursor when I hover over certain text/image in a slide. I've been Googling about it and so far, I've only found out about the Hyperlink -> Bookmark -> Screentip feature. But with this method though, I am quite limited in the number of characters I can use and also, there's no text formatting (layout, indentation, new line space, etc.) I only end up with a square wall of text.  Is there another way of achieving what I have in mind without having to create another slide for it that simulates a pop up text box? I simply want a simple-looking tooltip that can contain somewhat extensive text descriptions in a easy-to-read layout and so far, Google doesn't seem to want to lead me to the right place so here I am instead.  Also; Is it possible to simply have a small image (a drawing of a clipboard with a few click-able links on it) to slide in after I click on something on the current slide?  To elaborate: The current slide has many interactive images (action buttons) in it, one of which is a small shape (or an image of a button) with the text ""HINTS"" in it. I would like it to be able to click it so that a drawing of a clipboard would then slide in -- the said clipboard drawing also contains a few more interactive buttons in it. Clicking on the HINTS button again would hide the clip board. Now, while the clipboard is still present on the screen, I still want to be able to have access to the other buttons that are already present prior to having the clipboard slide in.  How would you go about this? The only way I could think of right now is to duplicate the slide, add the clip board image on the duplicated slide and then have the HINTS button on the first slide link to the duplicate slide (with the clipboard present) and then link the HINTS button on the duplicate slide to the first slide (the one without the clipboard). I think that method is very time-consuming and duplicating stuff might end up drastically enlarging the file size.  Is there a much more efficient way of achieving what I have in mind?

"Cody, with all due respect, but that goes into a completely wrong direction. Date() is used to CREATE a date value from components for year, month and day. Datevalue() is used to CREATE a datevalue from a text string. None of these functions can be used to CHECK if a cell contains a date.  SpinazRoger1, is your data validation set up so that the user gets a warning and is still allowed to enter text into the date cell?

This can be done by setting the data validation style to ""Stop"" on the Error Alert tab, as shown in the screenshot.    With this setting, only dates can be entered into the cell and text won't be allowed.  If, however, for some reason you do want to allow text as well, but you only want to show the result in B1 if the data entered in A1 is a date, then you can check with IsNumber() instead of Len() in your IF statement.   Of course, since all dates are stored as numbers internally, the user could just type in a number, and if that number falls within the date range you allowed in the data validation settings, then the IsNumber function would also return TRUE.",3,0.5713065813493208,0.849793046501755,True,False,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,3,0.5,781,81,73,False,False,False,False,0.057,0.817,0.126,0.9187

"Hi JohnnyElia,   Welcome to the Skype Community forum. I can see why you are concerned. I’d be glad to assist you.   If you're having technical problems with Skype, sometimes uninstalling and reinstalling Skype can help. Please advise them to install the latest version of Skype and consider updating your group chat, learn more. In the event that the issue still persists, try the below:  In any chat, type /msnp24 hit enter. Don't worry, your contacts won't see the message you sent. Once done, restart Skype and see if that fixes the issue you're having. Let us know the result.   Please let me know if you have other questions.

"I am not sure, but I suspect this is a memory issue.  Microsoft likes to add bells and whistles for the Marketing types not realizing that Excel is used by the Accounting types and we hate the bells and whistles, especially when they stop us from doing our jobs.  They also assume that each time they put out a new product your computer power X10. To find out if this is the case, we can look to see if you are doing other things using a lot of memory.  Common ones in my experience are Vlookups over a large range, conditional formatting over a large range, or a random cell like XXA876583 having a space instead of being blank, which means that not only does Excel store the space in cell XXA876583, but it stores in memory that every other cell above and left of that cell is blank (well, and it stores the data you care about too). The third is the easiest to fix and won't be a bother for you, just go to the lower right corner of your data and see if your scroll bars are at the bottom left.  If they are not, scroll left to the edge of the scroll bar, then delete all columns between where you now are and your data.  do the same thing with rows from the bottom of the scroll bar to the bottom of your data. For conditional formatting, well...ouch...turn it off. For vlookups or other complex formulas, well...ouch, do a copy-paste special-values and replace your formulas with numbers.

" The trick is to not think of it as between, but as a set of exclusions. Step 1, is the number less than 1711?  If yes, then *7, else go to step 2. Step 2, is the number less than 3331?  If yes then *6, else go to step 3. Step 3, *5. You see, you don't need to worry about the number being less than 1711 in step 2 because in step 1 you already removed anything less than 1711 from your list, by multiplying it by 7 and ending your if statement. I could also write the if statement the following ways: =if(A1>3330, A1*5,if(A1>1710, A1*6, A1*7)) =if(A1>3330, A1*5, if(A1<1711, A1*7, A1*6)) =if(A1<3330, if (A1>1711, A1*6, A1*7), A1*5) The latter was an attempt to check for your ""between"" first.  But if statements are not designed to worry about ""between,"" you use two ifs for that. The trick is to remember that excel follows each ""if"" rule in order, so once it has done the first task, any number affected by that if statement is not available to the later if statements.  So if you have your first question be ""is A1>3330"" then you no longer have to worry about your number being >3330, because you already dealt with all those customers with your first if.",4,0.3280943605081601,0.9224081447439771,True,False,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4,0.8,723,68,65,False,False,False,False,0.046,0.849,0.105,0.9182

"Lisa et al -  Just an update after a little more troubleshooting.  Again, I'm not a programmer and my troubleshooting is limited to more of an 'desktop' style.  This post's purpose is to sharing information for others more than anything.  So, I decided to open task manager during the running of a slide with the LiveWeb control to see if I can see any process that were running with the thought of maybe getting a Process Explorer app installed and get more granular.  Windows Task Manager looks like this when hitting the slide with LiveWeb (screen shot inserted)    You'll notice on the third process under Microsoft PowerPoint (32 bit) (3) a process that just shows a ""Window Icon"" but does not provide any text to indicate what it is.  That line and icon do indeed represent the LiveWeb control. This (as stated in initial post) confirms the add-in is running correct and not erroring or being blocked.  In TaskManager if you right-click that Window Icon and choose ""Bring to Front"" while on the first pass of viewing that slide the contents display (so a second visit is not needed).   Of course, this cannot be done or would not be effective while running the PowerPoint presentation.  In my layman's terms, I believe maybe the embedded control is loosing top window focus and therefore is not seen on the first visit to the slide.  I just don't understand why if you go back (or forward) and then revisit the slide a 2nd time it THEN puts that window in the front.  WORKAROUND IN PLACE Again, just sharing information that I am seeing.  My work around has been to create a custom Slide Show with only the slides that have the embedded control and let them cycle through once before the 'live' presentation begins.  I then stop the custom show (without exiting PowerPoint) and run the full show.  All of the content on LiveWeb slides displays perfectly.  I am using the add-in unlike most;  the LiveWeb control is used on 70 different slides to show individual PDF or PNG files. LiveWeb has been a HUGE help to us. I know most others would use it on one possibly two slides in a presentation.

"SOLUTION TO BLOCKING ADVERTISEMENT: Thanks to Ellen Barry for posting this to Microsoft Sudoku page on Facebook. The solution is to change the size of Fonts and Icons (Change DPI Scaling Level). Windows ensures that everything appears on the screen at a usable and consistent size by instructing applications to resize their content by a scale factor. Most desktop monitors and notebook LCD's are usually in the range of 95-110 DPI, Windows sets a scale factor of 100% by default. When you change the DPI scaling level for your monitor, it changes the size of text, apps and other items to appear larger or smaller. A higher DPI level has everything appear larger, and a lower DPI level has everything appear smaller. Start with all apps closed, and right-click an empty area on your desktop, and click Display Settings. Click on Display on the left pane. If you have more than one display connected to your computer, then select a monitor in the right pane that you want to change the DPI of. Under Change the size of text, apps and other items, move the slider left or right to the DPI percentage you want to set for that monitor. 6. Click on Apply. 7. If the selected DPI is optimal for your usage, click on Sign out now for the settings to take effect.  My Surface Pro (1) was set to 150%.

I could then select the map and click save to my maps and a list of all my maps would appear. I'd add the location to my Bridges of the San Francisco Bay Area map. I would occasionally export those files as KML and load on my phone where I could pull them up, even when I was offline. My places in the new Google Maps has pretty much disappeared. Now I need an alternative. I just tried adding one of my most important maps to Bing Maps. After the import a message came up that the new map was limited to 200 POIs. Is there any way around that?

Before posting this I obviously checked all the normal places.  First off - Googling this I got this advice: This made no sense - using Skype on Mac OS and Chrome. The propriety app for Mac has no ability - so you have to use a browser. I can change my name - and lots of other stuff under edit profile - but my picture is locked.  So I followed some advice that said to do it in Outlook - since Microsoft and Skype are linked in some way. I went on to my Outlook account. Two things came to light - 1. I have a different picture already active on this account and 2. It said (IE confirmed) that my Skype and Outlooked were linked. Interesting conflicting data here perhaps since the images are different. If the accounts were linked - the images should surely be the same. I changed the image on my Outlook account - but it did nothing to change the one on my Skype account.

"I agree that it is unusual that I see no comma but please note, this lack of a comma on the sign-in keyboard only occurred after the recent update.

But to be honest with you, the only other way to use Skype on your Mac OS X 10.7.5 is to update it to at least Mac OS X 10.9 or higher. Otherwise, using a supported device is an option.   Skype is always making improvements, such as enhanced quality, better reliability, and improved security. Because we want everyone to experience the best Skype has to offer, it's sometimes necessary to retire older versions of Skype, and Skype enabled devices.

"Hi Candace,   Good Day!   Please be advised that you are being asked for a “Parental Permission” is because the system detected that your age on file is below 13 years of age that’s why it was categorized as a “Child Account”.   But you don’t have to worry about this one because we can change the date of birth on your account, so you can have the correct age on file.   First option is to create a new Microsoft account with a different email address/username and a correct date of birth. And I believe that this is the fastest and the most convenient way for you or if you really want to retain that email address/username, we can change the date of birth of it using these options:   Option 1: Provide a valid credit card number:   Note: Microsoft can only accept a US credit card. Microsoft account was created with a US address, but you have a credit card form another country/region, this option won’t work. Use option 2 or 3 to fix this problem. If you’re a parent trying to change your child’s birth date, this option won’t appear.

"Dear April,  Thanks for your quick reply. I've uploaded and shared a video via PM. In regard to your other questions, I can share the information publicly as follows:  I'm not sure about previous versions of PowerPoint 2016, whether the same issue occurred or not. It does not occur in PowerPoint 2011 for Mac, that is for certain. I'm also unsure what you mean about ""configuring settings""—which settings do you mean? I have applied the latest updates to Office, though, as part of the Office 365 subscription.  Yes, the identical issue occurs on a different Mac using the same file, this time with the latest version of Sierra.  I have confirmed that it doesn't matter whether I am plugged into an external display or not—the issue still occurs.   Unfortunately, I cannot share the file due to confidentiality issues, but the issue can be reproduced as follows without that file:  I have reproduced this issue on two Macs running El Capitan, and one running Sierra. It would seem that this is a pretty serious bug, since it hinders users from safely switching between views when there is text in the Notes pane/field.

"Hello everyone I have the following system: * Nokia Lumina 2520 tablet running Windows RT 8.1 I have had the tablet from new since December 2013 and it has run perfectly until just a few weeks ago, when Windows Updates stopped working.  I had tried to solve this issue through a wide range of means identified on this forum, but without success and so I have today reinstalled Windows RT 8.1 (not refreshed), specifying even that this re-installations should be for the purpose of the PC being recycled.  I would imagine that this means that it is the cleanest re-install possible. The reinstall went smoothly and I allowed it it use default settings.  Based on this, I have not changed any system settings.  This was also the state that the tablet was installed in when I initially bought it and when Windows Update worked correctly. I have connected to the internet using a tried and tested connection with no problems and have run Windows Update for the first time.  However, after some twenty-five minutes, this remains stuck on the 'checking for updates' screen with an animated progress bar. I have posted a view-only copy of the 'Windows Update.Log' file to the following link: https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=D99316A6D105B619!1411&authkey=!AGXLjp5qlx5eSQk&ithint=file%2clog Would anybody have any ideas as to the problem here?

"Hi,   Method 1: When the photos are on external storage or memory card. Computer recognizes the external storage & even sees the phone's folders, you can copy the photos from the folder and paste it on your computer. Method 2: When photos are on the phone's internal memory and not on the external memory card. When you hook up like this, all you see is what's on the external microSD card, you cannot see or access what's on the phone's memory. It is possible however to move the photos from the phone's internal memory to the external memory card. Click on the Folder widget on the main screen (or ""My Stuff"" from the Settings screen), then at the top, look at the tabs - click on the middle one to view the phone's memory contents. Now click on the lower left ""notebook-like"" icon and then click ""Move"" and then select the photos you want to move, then click Move. Now it should be highlighting the right tab - the external memory - so choose the folder you want to move the photos to, or create a new folder, or just use the current folder. That's it. Now you will be able to access these photos via the computer/USB cable method because they are now on the microSD card. For further help please contact the device manufacturer.

"Hi Frederick Gupta  Previously I connected my external SSD drive to the RT and then attempted to boot the tablet. However the tablet refused to boot. I do not remember seeing any error messages. I just presumed they were incompatible.   However after received your reply this morning I decide to boot the RT and then connect the drive. I did this but very soon after connecting the drive I got a blue screen with white reverse type saying: Your PC ran into a problem needs to restart. We are collecting some information and then we will restart it for you. It also stated I could look at the error message at uaspstor.sys. After collection it did commence to restart but never quite got there and after about 20 minutes I forcibly shut it down. I then disconnected the drive and rebooted again and then connected he drive again once the boot was finished. To my surprise after connecting the drive I heard the familiar sound of a USB port connecting. Looking in 'Safely remove hardware and remove media' icon on the taskbar I found it was connected via a 'USB to ATA/Atapi bridge'. I opened file explorer and found I could access and open my files.  However after a short time I received another blue screen with a similar message to that above with the addition of the error IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL . After going through another information collection and restarting procedure the disk seems to be working OK. I can disconnect it via the before mentioned icon, connect it to my windows 10pro desktop and my RT will even boot with the external disk attached. I have notice that two temp files have been installed on the external disk - rtr3dda.temp and rtr949.temp.  The external disk is a Samsung SSD 850 EVO mounted in an Orico 2.5"" USB enclosure.  I am very happy that your questions helped me to get the results above. Your comments on the above would be greatly appreciated.

"@Kevin K, I don't believe that has anything to do with the question being asked. As far as I know, this is a universal problem with Windows since the beginning and remains in Windows 10. Windows does not store Windows sizes. If you change your screen resolution so that the it's too small for existing windows, they will resize down to fit. Then, when you restore to the other higher resolution, the windows don't change. They ONLY change if the resolution is too small for them.  This also occurs in tablet mode when moving between landscape and portrait, because the previously long dimension becomes only the width of the new short dimension. For example, if you have a 2520x1440 screen in landscape, and have a window that's about 2,000 pixels across, then rotate to portrait mode, it will be resized down to 1440 or less pixels (often less because it may keep the upper left point at the same place, meaning the remaining width to the edge of the screen is even shorter).  This is fine and reasonable for changing resolutions. The problem is that the windows don't restore when reverting to the prior resolution. I have never seen it work they way we would expect on any system (have not checked a Surface Pro, maybe it's finally fixed there). Definitely not a function of having the latest drivers, at least not in most cases.",3,0.6181055002129295,0.8970001655501545,False,True,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3,0.75,870,97,92,False,False,False,True,0.03,0.933,0.038,0.2292

Note If SFC could not fix something, then run the command again to see if it may be able to the next time. Sometimes it may take running the sfc /scannow command 3 times restarting the PC after each time to completely fix everything that it's able to.  If not, then run the Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth command to repair any component store corruption, Repair-WindowsImage -Online -CheckHealth  Repair-WindowsImage -Online -ScanHealth  Repair-WindowsImage -Online -RestoreHealth Restart the PC afterwards, and try the sfc /scannow command again.  If still not, then try using OPTION ONE above to run the sfc /scannow command at boot  If still not, then you could do a refresh of Windows 8, or run a System Restore using a restore point dated before the bad file occured to fix it. You may need to repeat doing a System Restore until you find a older restore point that may work.  If still not, then you can use the steps in the TIP box in the OPTION THREE section to manually replace the files that SFC could not fix. __________________________________________________ ""How to Refresh Windows 8 and Windows 8.1"" http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/2293-refresh-windows-8-a.html Refreshing your PC goes like this: The PC boots into Windows RE (Recovery Environment).

'printserver110.exe' errors and other critical malfunctions can arise when the Windows operating system becomes overloaded with invalid system references, as well as corrupted and deleted registry files.
