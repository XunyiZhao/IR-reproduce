"SOLUTION TO BLOCKING ADVERTISEMENT: Thanks to Ellen Barry for posting this to Microsoft Sudoku page on Facebook. The solution is to change the size of Fonts and Icons (Change DPI Scaling Level). Windows ensures that everything appears on the screen at a usable and consistent size by instructing applications to resize their content by a scale factor. Most desktop monitors and notebook LCD's are usually in the range of 95-110 DPI, Windows sets a scale factor of 100% by default. When you change the DPI scaling level for your monitor, it changes the size of text, apps and other items to appear larger or smaller. A higher DPI level has everything appear larger, and a lower DPI level has everything appear smaller. Start with all apps closed, and right-click an empty area on your desktop, and click Display Settings. Click on Display on the left pane. If you have more than one display connected to your computer, then select a monitor in the right pane that you want to change the DPI of. Under Change the size of text, apps and other items, move the slider left or right to the DPI percentage you want to set for that monitor. 6. Click on Apply. 7. If the selected DPI is optimal for your usage, click on Sign out now for the settings to take effect.  My Surface Pro (1) was set to 150%. When I changed back to 100% my screen fonts all went smaller (sadly), but the game now works properly.",0.3619354978199986,0.9678153258045791,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,3,1.0,1356,129,122,False,True,False,False,0.027,0.935,0.037,6,0

If i am talking to multiple people thay cant all fit in on the zoomed in screen. I used to just double tap the screen in the old version to get it to zoom out but now i can only zoom it out if it makes me bigger so i have to look at myself taking up the whole screen rather than the people im talking to. Help!! Otherwise how can i go back to the old skype before the stupid update?",1.0000000000000002,0.8758835875117548,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,1,0.25,626,73,70,True,False,True,False,0.059,0.915,0.026,0,1
"Hi Carlos,  Welcome to the Skype Community forum.  Thank you so much for letting us know about this. We truly understand how important this is for you. Let me assist you with this.  If you're on a group video call, you can change the view of which video you'd like to be in the foreground. Just tap their profile picture at the top right corner of your screen, videos should shrink. If you'd like to minimize their videos, just drag it upward - you should be seeing a check mark icon. By the way, we do not recommend using an older version of Skype due to various reasons, i.e. security updates, bug fixes, additional features etc.  I hope this helps. Let us know if you have questions.

"Hi Carlos,   Thank you for getting back to us.  Zooming out of the screen to see the entire image depends on your camera's aperture. An iPhone device is averaging from f/1.45 to f/2.2 sensor. Due to the smaller sensor the iPhone lens has a much smaller field of view compared to its focal length, hence the range of angles the physical aperture has to be visible from is much reduced.

"Janet, Yes, I am changing the notes master in View tab - Notes Master.  I am on Office 365 and should have the most recent version. I don't have any pending updates. Version 15.37 is what the about box shows.  My guess is that there are some slides that were pasted in from various presentations and some how they kept their original formatting and won't change when Notes Master is changed. Some slides do seem to update to the new format while others don't. I have found some slides with multiple text boxes (on top of one another) so the bottom one (which isn't visible) is updated with some stray box on top of it in the old format.   Another oddity is that some slides (possibly originally created in Keynote) let me change the font but won't let me change formatting (bold, italic). Really weird.  I am plowing through this with my workaround but it would be swell if there was easy access to an ""Apply Notes Master"" command on every page like there used to be. (I think it was a right click to the list of commands.) The only reliable way to change the Notes formatting themselves is to cut the text, delete the text box, and go to Normal view and Paste Text Only which recreates the text box with the current Notes Master formatting. But this won't change the placement of the slide (which I have occasionally had to move or make smaller). Sometimes the only work around to fix that is to create a new slide, copy the slide elements to it and copy the notes. Thanks for anything you might be able to do to help in the future.

" Bryan,  The main problem I see with the solution above is that most businesses do not have the capability for an iPhone or iPad to use AirPlay to connect to the projectors or TVs found in conference rooms, ballrooms, etc. where business people given PowerPoint presentations.  I think the best solution for any mobile device (iOS or Android) is to have PowerPoint running on a Windows or Mac PC, connected to the projector, and then have the mobile device connected via Bluetooth to the PC/Mac.   The reason this is important is that more customers are using TVs vs. projectors.  Normal laser pointers do not work on them.  Also, if you are in a larger room with multiple displays, the laser pointer cannot display on all screens.  I saw a person use the Android remote app today and it was impressive.  It would be a great addition for Microsoft to support this.  Thanks!

  I agree with Tammy on how businesses are set up: laptops connected to projectors or HDTVs and the need to present standing up while pointing to things on the large screen needs either an external device that acts as a powerpoint presenter tool OR the old Android app that worked wonders and had functionality that is simply not there in the iOS app after so much time- I mentioned the Android app funcctionality in my email last year...

"Hello Sammy,  Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.  I would like to know some information about the issue so that we could help you better.  What is the reason of performing factory reset?  I appreciate your efforts towards resolving the issue.  Before you perform factory reset, I would suggest you to perform startup repair from Windows recovery environment and check if it helps.  If you can't start (boot) your PC, follow these instructions to get to the ""Windows Recovery Environment"". You may need to connect a keyboard to complete the steps. Please follow these steps:  a. Do one of the following, depending on whether you have installation media (such as a DVD or USB flash drive):  - If you have installation media for Windows 8.1, start (or boot) your computer from the installation media. Insert the DVD or USB flash drive and restart your computer. If you see a message asking you to ""Press any key to boot from DVD or USB"", do so. If you don’t see the message, you might need to change the boot order in your computer's BIOS settings so that it first starts from the DVD or USB. When you see the ""Install Windows"" page, tap or click ""Repair your computer"" to start the ""Windows Recovery Environment"".  - If you don’t have installation media, use the power button to restart your computer three times. This will start the ""Windows Recovery Environment"".  b. In the ""Windows Recovery Environment"", on the ""Choose an option"" screen, click ""Troubleshoot"".  c. Click ""Startup repair"" and follow on-screen instructions.  Important Notes: Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.  I highly recommend backing up all of your important files and folders onto an external storage device before attempting any type of OS repair or upgrade.

I've got a slightly different issue today, though should be able to help your query as not sure you've had the best responses so far.  I've been using the Photo's App on my Surface Pro 4 successfully for the past few months.  It works great - I just take photos on my mobile phone, they upload into One Drive, and then hey presto I return everytime to the Albums section in the Photo's App and I've got a nice neat album of quality photo's from the day.  Indeed, not all the photos are present - I noticed this and seems normal functionality.  I found this odd at first, though now I get how this works:  ""Collections"" stores all your photos - which is effectively your 'folders' ""Albums"" is Microsoft's way of digesting the photos in your folder/collection, to a user-friendly, readily viewable album folder.  The Photos App seems to cleverly apply some logic to: remove duplicate photo's, select the best photo's, identify a choice few photos from similar images, remove blurred images, remove poorly lit images.  What's is left seems to be the App's best attempt to start a great album for you, to summarise the photo's from the day.  In addition to this, it chooses a good album cover photo, and also applies the ""Enhance"" to enhance all the images in the Album.   The result (and ultimate benefit), is that by doing nothing, you can just open up your album and immediately have available a good album set to view yourself or show to others.  If you want *all* photo's just go to Collections - which is unfiltered.  So Albums starts off an album for you based on the photo's taken for that day.  I then 'optimise' the album by choosing ""Edit"" in the top right corner, then click + 'Add or Remove photos'.  The logic applied is excellent, although it doesn't always get all the photos you want, so I manually select/de-select photos as appropriate.  I have found this really useful, as when taking photo's I do have many duplicates and blurred ones - I also have 100's of photo directories, and going through each one is a) very time consuming and b) I don't like to delete photo's, so the Album is a useful ""view"" on photo's you want. I find it great for showing kids/parents.  In summary, it's normal functionality - just use Collections if you prefer all photos.  I'm no expert in this btw, this is just how I've been using it.  For info, I have a separate problem in that since the Aug 2016 Microsoft Windows 10 update, I have now lost all my albums ...",0.5768205059829066,0.8736294938967601,False,True,True,False,True,False,False,True,7,0.875,2465,220,201,False,False,False,False,0.027,0.833,0.141,24,7

Only way to get it back was to again uninstall and reinstall the Xbox App. I was able to then launch the Game Bar and this time it stayed open. But if I then go to launch the game it disappears. I've discovered that if I toggle the slider from Off to On in Settings > Gaming >Game Bar i can get it back but it's acting really weird.  Accessing the Game bar menu locks up the screen and I have to restart Explorer to get everything back.   So I've got it to show but I'm still completely unsuccessful actually getting it to now work with a game. If I have to toggle the slider in  Settings > Gaming >Game Bar to get it to work, then the game minimizes. Then when I click to relaunch the game neither Win + G or Ctrl + Shift + G works to launch game Bar because the Settings menu is then not the active window. So I'm stuck in that fail loop. Clicking the game maximizes the game, but no Game bar .... Clicking Settings to toggle the slider allows me to show the Game Bar but the game isn't maximized to allow the Game Bar to recognize it .... I click the Game bar menu settings and it then locks up the screen .... so there's no way to activate both at the same time - I either have an active Game Bar and no game, or an active Game and no Game Bar.

"Thank you for your response. For PC games in full-screen mode, you won’t see the Game bar, but you can use the Windows logo key + Alt + R to start and stop recordings.

Now that I understand that better, I can see that it works, but only if I use the method I mentioned to reset it for each instance of use - that is to toggle the slider from On to Off to On again in Win 10 PC Settings > Gaming >Game Bar That seems to be the only way I can get it to work. Whether that's intended function or not ... it works and I can live with that for now. I'd go to a third party app b4 spending any more time on this.   The other part is that when accessing the Game bar menu I can make changes, but for some reason it still locks up the screen and I have to restart Explorer to get everything on my desktop back. But when I reopen Game Bar the changes have been saved so it is technically working, but with the Explorer restart glitch. So 50% success with this but I don't want to waste any more time on this. I will revisit this after WIndows 10's next major update where I'll choose to reinstall the OS, rather than slipstream the updates.

"Hi Daisy, Welcome to Microsoft Answers!  In addition to Coork's post, you  may follow  these steps. Check if the issue persists in Safe Mode. Method 1: Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs do not run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start Windows are installed. Safe mode is useful for troubleshooting problems with programs and drivers that might not start correctly, or that might prevent Windows from starting correctly. If a problem does not reappear when you start in safe mode, you can eliminate the default settings and basic device drivers as possible causes. If a recently installed program, device, or driver prevents Windows from running correctly, you can start your computer in safe mode and then remove the program that is causing the problem. 1. Restart your computer. Click the Start button, click the arrow next to the Lock button, and then click Restart. 2. Do one of the following: ·  If your computer has a single operating system installed, press and hold the F8 key as your computer restarts. You need to press F8 before the Windows logo appears. If the Windows logo appears, you will need to try again by waiting until the Windows logon prompt appears, and then shutting down and restarting your computer. ·  If your computer has more than one operating system, use the arrow keys to highlight the operating system you want to start in safe mode, and then press F8. 3. On the Advanced Boot Options screen, use the arrow keys to highlight the safe mode option you want, and then press ENTER. Log on to your computer with a user account that has administrator rights. When your computer is in safe mode, you'll see the words Safe Mode in the corners of the display. To exit safe mode, restart your computer and let Windows start normally. If the issue does not occur in Safe mode, perform a clean boot. Method 2: Follow these steps to perform a Clean Boot. Note If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps. We strongly recommend that you do not use the System Configuration utility to modify the advanced boot options on the computer unless a Microsoft support engineer directs you to do this. Doing this may make the computer unusable. a. Log on to the computer by using an account that has administrator rights. b. Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility.If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue. c. On the General tab, click Selective Startup, and then click to clear the Load startup items check box. (The Use Original Boot.ini check box is unavailable.) d. On the Services tab, click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box, and then click Disable all. Note: Following this step lets Microsoft services continue to run. These services include Networking, Plug and Play, Event Logging, Error Reporting, and other services. If you disable these services, you may permanently delete all restore points. Do not do this if you want to use the System Restore utility together with existing restore points. e. Click OK, and then click Restart. Note: Reset the computer to start as usual After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual: a. Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue. b. On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK. c. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.

"Hi I'm trying to remove search results from Bing, I have blocked with robots.txt and after that gone into the webmaster tools --> block urls https://www.bing.com/webmaster/configure/block/urls and registered the directory there, waited a little more than 24 hours, but the search results are still there.

"Hi,  I recently started college and they were advising us to download the Office Student pack that was being offered free.  Which I did - from the official site and not the college one (just in case it'd been hacked).  Ever since whenever I try to open any browser apart from Microsoft Edge, I get the windows installer popup flashing up as though it's on a permanent loop.  It took me several attempts to download the software as I had forgotten that I'd installed the old Microsoft Word - which I think was the 2007 version -  from the disk I got with my old computer (back when you were given MS works, etc as a freebie with your computer).  I didn't have the disk but downloaded a tool from the MS site that would remove the software and allow a clean install of the new software.  The end result of this is as I said above - it's looping the installer pop up and it's so bad I can't use the browsers (or the Rootsmagic 7 software I also had on my pc and had used to work on my family tree - only the defunct Family Tree Maker software is viewable but I can no longer access my tree online through it so it's rather a waste of time using it).  I'm at the stage I'm ready the pc out of the window as I'm so frustrated.  Computers never used to be so difficult, when did it all change?  You used to be able to uninstall one software and install the new without all these problems.....  I think perhaps the issue may be that I've inadvertently deleted something that these programs need to run, but I can't figure it out (not as computer-savvy as I used to be) If anyone has any ideas I can try I'd be grateful as when I search for my particular problem, I'm getting solutions for Windows 7 but I am on the latest update of Windows 10.

"It is doing that because every IF field is in its own paragraph, and Word still displays/prints the paragraph mark.

Before posting this I obviously checked all the normal places.  First off - Googling this I got this advice: This made no sense - using Skype on Mac OS and Chrome. The propriety app for Mac has no ability - so you have to use a browser. I can change my name - and lots of other stuff under edit profile - but my picture is locked.  So I followed some advice that said to do it in Outlook - since Microsoft and Skype are linked in some way. I went on to my Outlook account. Two things came to light - 1. I have a different picture already active on this account and 2. It said (IE confirmed) that my Skype and Outlooked were linked. Interesting conflicting data here perhaps since the images are different. If the accounts were linked - the images should surely be the same. I changed the image on my Outlook account - but it did nothing to change the one on my Skype account.

"Hi Karen - and thanks for hooking up with me here.  I'm using Skype V 7.56(776) on MacBook Pro Retina 15 mid 2015 - 2.8ghz i7 16GB RAM 1600 Mhz DDR3  I did as you suggested and was able to change my profile picture this morning - so thanks very much.  A few notes in passing:  Clicking on my profile picture as you suggest does nothing on Mac version. But DOUBLE clicking it (or clicking on the inset camera icon) does open a dialogue box where one can find a new picture. I did this and it worked - but it never actually gave me the text or written option as you list at point 2 - IE 'change picture' - I think it just assumes that's what you want to do..... anyway, like I say, it worked. So thanks again.  What still does NOT work - and really, it's at this point only for those that don't have the app installed - is I still can not change my picture through a browser. I log in to Skype.com and go to Profile and Personal Information and I can change my name and address here - but not my image. Who knows why!? - Anyway.

Hi I'm only able to share screens once during a call - if I stop sharing  and then try again it says that I am sharing but the other person does not see it.  I've tested it on a second account and it does only share screen the first time.  The second time it stays with the input camera. Any ideas?

"Hi,  Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.  I understand that you are unable to reinstall the Bing desktop.  I will certainly help you with this.  If a Bing app is removed when one or more Bing apps are running, the shared content for all currently installed Bing apps may be corrupted.  I would suggest you to go through the below methods:  Method 1: Try to perform clean boot:  A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7, or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.
