show on the task bar and still show the tab when I hover my mouse over it but when I clicked it it did nothing.   Check to see if you have a window that is moved off screen (or located on another monitor).  Right-click the Taskbar icon's thumbnail when you have raised it and choose Move from the thumbnail's window menu.  Notice the change in mouse pointer but in your case you can not use it to drag.  What you can do however is use a cursor key to engage the mouse pointer on the window's title bar for a drag move.  Then drag move the window into view.  In the case where the window is on a different monitor you would also have the (simpler) alternative of using a  Win+Shift+Cursor  move.

"First of all, the instructions from Christopher Chen will cause trouble sooner or later: A user document saved with the name Normal.dotm will not function properly as a basis for new documents. The Normal.dotm must be generated by the program.  It would have been better to Open the original Normal.dotm & change the Zoom level there. Unfortunately, this has been made difficult due to Apple's decision to make the Library folders for User Accounts Hidden by default [OS X 10.7 & later].

Now I have to warn everyone that they need to right-click the file, select ""Show in folder"" and open the last file received via Explorer (that shows correctly the renamed file), this is annoying and time wasting. IMHO it would be more useful to create new folders with name of the folder based on date and time (e.g. ""2017_09_28_14_35_58"") where new files can be received and if they have the same name, Skype should report the renamed version, this way Skype received files would not contain lots of obsolete files received from other people which makes finding the last received file even more difficult.

"Hi Gregory,   Welcome to the Skype Community forum.  I do understand the inconvenience you have faced. Don't worry, I'm here to assist you.  It is possible that you're signed in to a different Skype account. Your contacts, recent conversation history, Skype credit and subscription (if any) should sync across all your devices.  Are you signing in using a Skype name or an email address or maybe a phone number? If you've forgotten your account details, the best way to recover it is to go to our problems signing in page and follow the instructions. We'll show you all the Skype accounts associated with that email address or phone number.   I hope this helps. Please let us know if you have other questions.

"Earlier today I tried to do a bing search from my IE. From what I see the page has changed from what I normally see and am used to using. I was searching for a online game I had just beat called Tentacle Wars: PM to see if any other version were made or created, while I found a previously created game the images page that opened was different. So then clicked on videos and found the same style of change. Normally when I opened a web search for images or videos I would see a page of pictures and if you picked one it would ""open"" and popup in which you could see a ""toolbar"" of the previous and next pictures as well as enlarge the current picture and run the pictures thru slideshow. The video page would have a list of videos from different websites and also preview of the video if you placed the cursor over the image and if you clicked a video it would open in the popup screen and could play, pause,  go full screen. Now when I did the search today it only allows redirects to the page that the picture or video is hosted on, as well as the search list that appears only shows a few images or videos before you must go to the next page. Not sure if this is something that I can switch back to or something that Bing has done and will be the current version. I used to use the destop version of AOL on my old computer, and now that AOL is a webpage based site I have used Bing since. Not too tech savy but I'd hate to have to switch to a new browser or search engine.  Whats the story? Currently running an old XP with IE8, like I said Not tech savy or sure about new browser but I'd prefer to say on IE",1.0000000000000002,0.9121385496724812,True,True,True,False,True,False,False,True,1,0.125,1588,151,140,True,False,False,False,0.026,0.919,0.055,4,1

"Follow up from Matthew A15:  Thank you for the reply Smity. My first question after I wrote my post was would anyone reading it understand the issue or what I was describing. After I read your reply I began to think of a better way to describe it.  I searched ""Bing Image search"" and found a picture of the ""popup screen"" I was mentioning, it can be viewed at:  http://cdn2.ubergizmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/bing-image-search.jpg . Now as I described the search page is in the background of the screen and the ""popup window that has the options like enlarge, play slideshow.  When I searched ""Bing Video search"" I found a picture of the search result page for video, view here:  http://www.liveside.net/wp-content/images/2013/09/Bing-Video-Search.jpg. Now with each of these videos you see small icons on each video that would allow you to view the preview of the video (short few seconds) or if the video had to be viewed on the hosts page. Also a picture of the popup from a video viewed here: http://www.sitepronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Bing-video-search-4.jpg . Now in this you could watch the video while still on bing without a redirect (unless the video was marked that it was a redirect).  This is what I am looking for that browser/settings. Currently if I wish to search image or video I get a new window redirects to another site as well as only being able to view 28 (4x7) images before needing to go to the next page (the old version would just keep added them to bottom of page as well as having suggestions for other searches that could match).

"Hello TylerFogg,     We want to create the best possible app experience for our Skype users which means we must make some changes along the way. These decisions are hard to make but will enable us to focus our efforts on transitioning Skype from a peer-to-peer video and chat app to a modern, mobile friendly cloud architecture.    Skype on the cloud means you can access all of your chats and shared images on any device with the same Skype account and consume less battery power.   With these, we can no longer get back to the older version of Skype for iPad 6.35.1.   Alternatively, you can uninstall and reinstall Skype for iPad.   To uninstall Skype for iPad, simply touch and hold the Skype icon on your home screen until the icon begins to shake and an “x” appears in the corner of the Skype icon. Release the icon and then tap the “x”. This will delete Skype from iPad. Reboot your device. Reinstall Skype from the App Store and do another reboot before signing back in to Skype.

"When you say not referring to Autosave"" I am not sure if you mean the Auto Recover or AutoBackup. There is a description of AutoBackup at the following link. (Go down towards the end of the page under heading ""AutoBackup"")    https://www.online-tech-tips.com/ms-office-tips/excel-autorecover-and-automatic-backup/  However, the above method overwrites the previous backups and if this is not what you require and you want to keep several versions of backups then you will need to change the document to a Macro Enabled Workbook and use the Save Event VBA code below.   To install the VBA Event code:  Now when the workbook is saved, if changes have been made since opening,  then a backup file will be created in the same folder as the master. If no changes then the file will save as normal but no backup will be created. The backup File Name is in the format  Filename yyyy-mm-dd hh mm ss.xlsm The reverse date with year first is used so the file names can be sorted. All 2 digit months, days, hours, minutes and seconds are used because sorting is based on text and this ensures that sorting occurs correctly.  If the User selects ""Save As"" then the backup code is not implemented and allows the user to create a file name of choice. ie the user might select a backup version and the use Save As to replace the master copy.  Feel free to get back to me if any problems.   Copy all of the code below into the VBA editor.

"Hi Kings: My name is Ron. This appears to be an error code associated with upgrades, more than updates. There are several possible fixes mentioned #1 - Disable all Antimalware and firewalls, especially 3rd part ones. Make sure they are turned back on after the update is done. Try running the update. If that didn't work try #2 - restart all Windows services associated with Windows Update: - in Start Menu search for ""CMD"" - right click on it and select ""Run as Administrator"" - in the ""Command Prompt"" window enter the following commands one at a time net stop bits net stop wuauserv net stop appidsvc net stop cryptsvc - enter the following commands to rename the update install folders Ren %systemroot%SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak Ren %systemroot%system32catroot2 catroot2.bak (wait a while after the fix is complete and you are sure it is working, then come back and delete these folders, which at that point are just wasting space.) - restart the update services net start bits net start wuauserv net start appidsvc net start cryptsvc Now try update As well, this is a ""voodoo fix"".

How am I supposed to record a video message if I want to put the phone on something to be able to record myself in full height? Say, to show avnew outfit or something else?  I've just tried to follow your instructions and also discovered that the length of the video is very short now. From three minutes it's been dropped to something about 30 seconds.  Thus, I wonder, why the update degrades the features in the app? From now on you have to hold the button instead of just tapping it and the length of the video is decreased by factor six.  Shouldn't the app update improve the features instead?  And I don't even mention the absence of ability to set the status in the profile in the latest version.",0.33835789469035304,0.9055587585293584,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,3,0.75,969,104,104,True,True,True,False,0.025,0.907,0.068,2,2

The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove virus, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software. http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx   Note: 1) The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.                                                               2) If you run the virus scan the program that is infected with virus will get deleted. So you have to reinstall the program. Also if the files and folders are affected with virus then they might even get deleted. Method 2: Refer to the link mentioned below and check if it helps:     Method 3: If the issue does not resolve try to reset the internet explorer and check the issue.

"Hi Eric,   You can create a macro based on the article you provided to send back the last modified time in your workbook. Since you are using Excel 2016 for Mac, I will show you how to do it on Mac.   1. Go to Develop tab, if you don't have it, go to Excel > Preference > Ribbon > check the Develop tab. Then click Visual Basic button.    2. Right click ThisWorkbook and choose Insert > Module.   3. In the VB editor, insert VB script:   Function LastModified() as Date         LastModified = ActiveWorkbook.BuiltinDocumentProperties(""Last Save Time"")   End Function   4. Close VB editor and save the workbook as a macro-enabled workbook, open the workbook again, in the cell you want to display the last modified time, insert =lastmodified(), if the time doesn't displayed as expect, you can change the cell format to Date or Time.   Meanwhile, you can add another macro to skip the step of insert formula manually.   Follow the steps 1,2 mentioned above to create a new module, type in the following script:   Sub formula()       Range(""C4"").formula = ""=lastmodified()""   End Sub   Click Macros under Develop tab, select the macro and click Options, then assign a shortcut key to the macro.

"In Microsoft excel how do you lookup a certain value in a row and then look up another value in that row and then count the amount of times that second value appears in the row is the question. So in other words, the first value identifies the row the second value identifies what to look for in that row then instead of returning that exact value it returns the amount of times that value shows up in the specific row.  Example: So lets say you have a workweek sheet and a workweek summary sheet. On the workweek sheet it highlights the workers and the work done at different times during the day. On the summary Sheet it uses that data to tell you who (Value 1)  did what assignment (Value 2) and how many times they did it (Adding it). Of course that person would be doing different things during the day so it needs to be able to tell the difference (case sensitive). It does not need to tell you what time they did it since its based on a week that would be unnecessary data it just needs to tell you how many times they did a assignment during that week. And since persons may change through out the week once you type in a name to search and work assignment it should auto change its total(automated system i am looking for) .

"Hello everyone, Sometimes when I open my computer up from sleep mode I get this error. I also noticed that sometimes my laptop freezes to the point where I must force a restart and after logging back in I receive the same notification. The solutions I saw online mentioned a couple of programs that were badly written Trojans and to uninstall them, but when I went through the steps looking for them my computer did not have those particular programs to delete. My friend recommends to just wipe the computer and start all over, but I really am hoping it does not come down to that because I don't want to have to install all of my drivers again.

In order to install Windows XP on the partition you created, you will need to boot into your BIOS and set the hard disk mode to IDE. -------------------------------------------- After you have set the hard disk IDE mode, you can proceed to install Windows XP on the partition you created; Insert your Windows XP CD, then restart your computer. When prompted to boot from the CD, do so. This requires pressing any key on your keyboard. Windows XP will go through its setup process.

Here are the instructions for doing that: http://www.vistax64.com/general-discussion/271218-switch-ahci-ide-tutorial-howto.html Welcome all , so let me explain I installed Windows 7 With AHCI set from Bios , but after that i wanted to use ide (becose it boots faster) and when i set Ide from Bios , the windows 7 loading screan camed upp and BSOD (Blue screen of death) with an error code 0x0000005B , i tryed the regedit trick by setting in the ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESystemCurrentControlSetServicesMsahci"" and then in the right pan the START value from 0 i set it to 1 and it supposed to be working but it was a failiure , it still did the Bsod and i was so pissed of , i wanted to make it work ... AND I DID IT !  Here are the pases : 1) I assume u have installed Windows Vista or Windows 7 with AHCI set from BIOS ! 2) Download my registry fix (to add the ide keys to regeditor) simply apply the key 3) Now the manually regedit part Go to :  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE_System_CurrentControlSet_Services_Msahci HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE_System_CurrentControlSet_Services_iaStor HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE_System_CurrentControlSet_Services_iaStorV  And in thease three keys in the right pan u will find a key named ""START"" change at all three (Msahci,iaStor,iaStorV) values from 0 To 1 Now navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE_System_CurrentControlSet_Services_PciIde ,then change the start value to ""0""    4) Now u are allmost done , restart your computer/laptop , and go to Bios and set from AHCI to IDE !!! , save settings in Bios and restart  5)Windows will be loading , and VOILA !!! NO BSOD !!! , windows Vista/Seven will install new Ide drivers and u will see in windows device manager that you dont have AHCI drivers anymore , u have Ide drivers ! 6)It will prompt for another restart , just restart it and u will be happy ---------------------------------  The first option I would recommend, if you really need to run Windows XP is to use Windows Virtual PC with Windows XP Mode, you will need to upgrade to Windows 7 Professional or Ultimate in order to gain access to Windows XP Mode.

"I installed Bing Desktop on my tablet so I could get the daily wallpaper. I installed it, and was really happy to see that my wallpaper became the Bing daily image. I heard Bing Desktop was part of Microsoft Update, so I checked Windows Update later on to see if there were any available updates. And that's when the problems started happening. Windows Update would either give me the error code 0x800705b4 or it would take really (and I do mean REALLY) long to check for updates and install them or say it's up to date. There was a fix that was said to be permanent, but was only a fix for one day for me. It was to turn off Microsoft Update in Advanced Options, restart, check for updates, re-enable Microsoft Update, check for updates, and then everything would work as it should. When I discovered this fix, I was really happy to know that everything would be okay. So I did what the instructions told me to do, and everything seemed fine. So the next day, I wanted to see what Bing's daily image was going to be. I logged on to my tablet, but the same image from yesterday was there, and it didn't update. I checked Bing's website, and the daily image was changed on the website. I went to Windows Update again to see if Bing Desktop needed an update to fix this problem, and I was greeted by the same Windows Update problems from yesterday. This meant that I had to do the fix EVERY DAY. Yeah, I don't want to restart my tablet every day just to fix a bug. And I realized the only way for Bing Desktop to update its image is if I restarted the tablet. Is there any way to fix these problems?

Is there any resources I can look at to guide me. Many thanks Ashley.,1.0,0.7843725731766659,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1,0.25,368,52,52,True,True,False,False,0.0,0.86,0.14,2,0
