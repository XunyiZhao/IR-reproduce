"Thanks, Ashley for this answer!  I guess I probably chose the wrong choice of words when I was Googling for how tos, that's why I can't seem to find anything relevant to what I'm trying to achieve in PP.  I was finally able to learn more about Triggers and ended up with much more interesting results with it.  I have a new question though (and likely the last);  Is there a way to make Mouse Overs serve as animation triggers? What I would like to do is to have an animated hand appear next to a line of text that I hover over. There'll be a list of texts (hyperlinks) and I thought it would be nice to have an animated cursor (animated pointing hand or an animated glowing arrow) appear to the left of each text I hover over.

"I installed Bing Desktop on my tablet so I could get the daily wallpaper. I installed it, and was really happy to see that my wallpaper became the Bing daily image. I heard Bing Desktop was part of Microsoft Update, so I checked Windows Update later on to see if there were any available updates. And that's when the problems started happening. Windows Update would either give me the error code 0x800705b4 or it would take really (and I do mean REALLY) long to check for updates and install them or say it's up to date. There was a fix that was said to be permanent, but was only a fix for one day for me. It was to turn off Microsoft Update in Advanced Options, restart, check for updates, re-enable Microsoft Update, check for updates, and then everything would work as it should. When I discovered this fix, I was really happy to know that everything would be okay. So I did what the instructions told me to do, and everything seemed fine. So the next day, I wanted to see what Bing's daily image was going to be. I logged on to my tablet, but the same image from yesterday was there, and it didn't update. I checked Bing's website, and the daily image was changed on the website. I went to Windows Update again to see if Bing Desktop needed an update to fix this problem, and I was greeted by the same Windows Update problems from yesterday. This meant that I had to do the fix EVERY DAY. Yeah, I don't want to restart my tablet every day just to fix a bug. And I realized the only way for Bing Desktop to update its image is if I restarted the tablet. Is there any way to fix these problems?

"I have been running Windows-7 for over a year now. But one thing that keeps happening is the ""Not Responding""  message. Does not matter what program I am using - Excel, Word, Outlook, and other NON-Microsoft programs. Example:  Excel: I can be entering Data - Type, Enter, Type, move mouse, type, move mouse, type use curser, etc. Then all of a sudden everything stops and it says NOT RESPONDING at the top. Can't do anything for 10 - 60 sec.  Then all is back to normal. This happens MANY MANY times per day. Another thing - maybe related - I am in Windows Explorer (or similar) and I sub file down to where I need to be and then click on a file to open - Example Excel.  Most of the time it opens in a few seconds. But sometimes it takes forever to open up and in the top bar when it shows the folders and sub-folders, a green bar starts going from left to right.  Nothing else happens and the bar so very slow.   Then somewhere between 50%-80% of the distance from left to right, the green bar will suddenly zoom all the way to the right and then the file opens. To me it is almost like a NOT Responding and the bar is trying.  Then when it decides to Respond the bar goes to the end and the file opens. Any clue about all these delays? By the way, I also have Process Explorer open and it shows nearly 80% plus SYSTEM IDLE. Of course I do not know what it says DURING the stoppage because I can't do much during the stoppage.

So any cell that has a value other than NO would be the AM1 value.  Below is an example of how It'd hope it would work.  So I just want the first value that appears in the column (and in this case it would beFEL1) to be the value what would appear in Cell AM1.

Skype on my other workstations seems to be fine. I did the steps that you recommended, I can hope it will fix the problem.

"Hi Lisa,  Thanks for the reply!  I was able to do as you suggested and manually added the ""mailto:"" part to the address and it opened right up in Mac Mail.  Note that it defaults to opening up the edit hyperlink window with the ""Web Page or File"" tab selected, not the ""Email Address"" tab. I didn't realize that at first and simply added ""mailto:"" to the address field that reads ""Link to an existing file or web page."". This worked though. When I click OK, test and then go back to the Edit window, the information updates and gets transferred to the correct ""Email Address"" tab. So that's good!  I did notice that it shows the ""mailto:"" code in the actual cell of the worksheet instead of being hidden code. When I go back in to check the edit hyperlink window it shows ""Text to Display:"" with the ""mailto:"" code, but the actual ""Email address:"" field shows the email address without the ""mailto:"" code. I can go back in manually and remove that mailto:"" from the Text to Display field and it still works properly. This is how a brand new email being added looks like in the Edit Hyperlink window. There is no ""mailto:"" code in either field. So it must automatically add the proper code behind the scenes to function.  Another thing to note is that when I go into one of the messed up emails and it opens automatically to the Web Page or File tab - the text to display field shows ""http://*** Email address is removed for privacy ***"" (for example). So that is probably what is causing the problem. So, my next question then...  Is there a way to update multiple cells at one time? I have hundreds of email addresses that need to be updated and editing manually would be very time consuming/expensive.

New message came up in red reading ""Pick another way to pay. This code isn't from a gift card"". My question is, why isn't Microsoft registering the redemption code and how come I can't redeem it over the store even though the code was from the official Mojang website? Any help would be greatly appreciated, Thankyou. Try that again Something happened on our end. Waiting a bit might help.

"Thanks for the reply.  I know how to see the browser history and timestamps. But I also log in at work and my browser at work is required to clear out history every day. So I log in with my personal live account, and use bing to search for things. This allows the searches to save to the https://www.bing.com/profile/history page. For a long time the Bing History page showed the prior search history in three columns with square thumbnails of the page visited with the search term and site inside the square and no timestamp. Sometime in the last few weeks it started to show the history as a row, in text, with a timestamp to the right. Then as of yesterday, it started to show the three column square again. I tried turning off the history in the page, and turning it back on, but it is still showing the old square thumbnail view.  Is there a way to turn the other view back on?

"Hi Lisa -  Thank you for your response and input WRT LiveWeb and Win10 Creator's update.  I spent some time on it tonight and Win10 1703 Feature Update (Creators) seems to be the culprit in the scenarios I tested.  Here's some info from my trials.....  I was able to do some further troubleshooting tonight and confirmed that the issue is only experienced after the Windows 10 Creators's update. I setup two VM's  (1-Win10Pro 1607 and 1-Win10Education 1607).  I installed Office 2016 Pro Plus on both VM's and then LiveWeb with the respective registry entries modified as needed.  I then inserted a few LiveWeb slides and ran the presentation and the pages and files both were displayed on the first time through.  I then ran Windows Update on both VM's and received the needed security patches up to but before the 1703 Creator's Feature Update.  I tested again with the presentation and the pages/files displayed on the first go around.    My next update to both VM's was the Creator's Update 1703 Feature update. Once that was loaded and systems rebooted I ran the Presentations and both DID NOT display the webpage/files with LiveWeb. :-(  While not resolved as of yet, I appreciate you guiding me to focus on the Creator's Update!   I'm happy to have narrowed it down, at least in my mind to the cause and it helps me with a more concise work around for the immediate.

Copy the file from removable storage to your hard drive, open it from there, save it, then move it back to removable storage if need be.  On the hard drive, don't store the file in a location that's automatically backed up/synched.  Or temporarily turn off the auto backup/synching while you're working on the file.

Why do you think you are hacked? Have you seen any odd things happen? Windows is like a very large ant hive there are millions of things goin on alle the time. Most normal people can't undestand the complexity of it all and that alone can get your mind spinning. For me it was Windows System log that started to give me errors that i couldent find an anwser for. The best way to deal with a hacker is very simple...unpluck the PC from internet...second best thing is keeping all programs updated. Run Antivirus software. Use Microsoft sites to learn how to tighten the security on your system. https://www.heimdalagent.com/da/home This little tool is great..keeps your system updated. http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/aa905062 Firewall Policy Wireshark ..or Network Monitor from microsoft. Monitor network trafic (warning this can give you grey hair) hehe Attack Surface Analyzer (Beta) Microsoft Security Assessment Tool Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer and so on...lots and lots of tools and documents to read.... So unless you are 100% sure your hacked you should just relax a bit have some beer and enjoy life away from PC a Bit....most the time if you get hacked..you wont even know it before they are gone and now are spending your money and drinking your beer :) Hope this helps alittle...if not someone else might have better anwsers.  ,2,0.3615654360597732,0.9066564591810002,True,False,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2,0.6666666666666666,970,113,109,False,False,False,False,0.068,0.778,0.154,0.9677

"Hi Eric,  The tests of the new Visual Basic for Applications VBE editor turned out really well. Everyone I know loves it.  The normal progression for updates is  Insider Fast (pre-beta) becomes Insider Slow (beta) Insider Slow becomes General Release  Insider Fast builds are weekly (sometimes even more often).  Insider Slow and general release are monthly. Insider Slow comes out about week before general release and is usually the same build.  Right now, the 15.39 Insider Fast build has a peculiarity where everything in Excel is upside down and mirrored in Sierra and High Sierra. I think they will have to fix that before it goes to Insider Slow. Once that is figured I expect that new editor will be moving to the next stage (Insider Slow).",6,0.2928048816836815,0.6933113829457797,False,True,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6,1.0,559,56,55,False,False,False,False,0.0,0.92,0.08,0.8655

"Hi Max,   Thanks for getting back!   I understand that you want to refresh the data in your Bing Finance App. You mentioned that the data showing for ORCL ticker is still for NASDAQ instead of NYSE. I tried to follow the same steps to add it on the watchlist and I was able to add ORCL under NYSE successfully. It might be that an update for your Bing Finance App is needed to fix this. Let’s try the steps below.   Cleanup watchlist: 1.       Tap or click the pencil symbol on the upper right corner of your Watchlist page 2.       Tap (x) symbol to remove list. 3.       Once the Watchlist is empty close your Bing Finance then re-launch. 4.       Try to re-add ORCL to NYSE   Another thing is to check for possible updates on your computer for Bing Finance. We had rolled out major set of updates to the app that makes it easy to customize to suit your needs. Please check this link for further details.   NOTE: Performing these steps might remove your current watchlist but you can certainly add all of it after reinstalling.   If the issue still persists, uninstall and reinstall the app: 1.       Right-click on the app and click on uninstall.  2.       Click on the store then reload the app.    After performing the steps above you should be able to see the ORCL ticker for NYSE.

"I bought a new Asus computer Sept. 2017. Text in the tool bars of a few programs were very small and almost impossible to read. One program was a VOIP Connect (program to make cheap phone calls) Other apps similar problems After 3 days of reading everything I could about the problem online and changing all the settings for fonts in various programs, no solution was found.  So I finally called Microsoft tech support  I had an older computer with the same apps/programs also running Windows 10 but an older version, and these apps/programs still worked fine with fonts big enough to read. so I had suggested the problem was a MS  Windows 10 problem. The tech as usual with MS did not want to believe this, and kept telling me the problems were with the apps.  That was until I let him access both computers and see both screens at the same time.  Old computer with big fonts in tool bars that could be read, and same apps open in new computer, with fonts in tool bars too small to read.  I spent 2 days with them for a total of at least 6 to 8 hours. They (from India) tried everything I had done several times, including uninstall and reinstall the apps/program, still no fix to very small fonts  The the MS tech finally reinstalled Windows 10 Ver 1703, that came with the new computer a few days earlier Below is what the MS tech wrote to fix the problem  if that kind of error occured fonts too small on some apps tool bars so please download the iso file of the windows version which the user is using  and then do repair your windows  open a browser and type media creation tool and click on download tool now then click on run  and then wait for that file to be downloaded then open that windows file and then click on setup and it will start installing the windows again and it will take time as according to the system speed minimum should be 40-50 min",3,0.610544151865143,0.904036804788185,False,True,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3,1.0,1261,125,115,False,False,False,True,0.074,0.897,0.029,-0.9415

"There are a couple of possibilities, but they'll involve additional fiddling with the text if you need to edit it.  One way is to replace the two-column section (and the section breaks at its beginning and end) with a two-column-one-row table and turn off its borders. You'll then have to manually move text (and any images) from the end of the first column to the second column to balance the column lengths. If you later add or remove anything in the table, you'll have to manually rebalance the columns.  Another way is to use two side-by-side text boxes. Use the Size settings on the Drawing Tools tab to make them the same size. To ensure that the text boxes stay where you want them, click Drawing Tools > Position > More Layout Options and set the first box to ""Left relative to Column"" and the second box ""Right relative to Column"", both of them ""Top relative to Margin"". Click in the left box and click the Create Link button on the Drawing Tools tab, and then click in the right box -- now text will ""flow"" from the left box to the right box. (Note that the boxes don't automatically resize when the text exceeds their total length -- another manual adjustment. They also don't continue to the next page; you'd have to draw another pair of text boxes and link from box 2 to box 3 and then from box 3 to box 4. There's a maximum of 32 linked boxes.)",6,0.4389634512981594,0.8950032360577367,False,True,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6,0.8571428571428571,909,90,83,False,False,False,False,0.0,0.962,0.038,0.8271

"On September 2nd I purchased an annual subscription (known as Premium membership) in order to play without watching adverts. About 6 weeks ago I lost the premium membership - being told that the subscription had ended and inviting me to renew. After putting a message on the in game message board the premium membership was restored after about 4 hours. I lost it again last Thursday night (December 17th). Another message posted without success. More than 1.5 hours spent on the telephone to Customer Services (MS) on Friday had me tearing my hair out. Eventually it took so long for them to put me through to technical support that Customer Services decided they were too busy to answer. I was told to contact them myself. Spoke to Xbox Customer Services, more helpful, and was advised again that I should deal with technical support. Found out that technical support do not work on a weekend. I then decided, today (Sunday) to speak to MS Accounts through whom I paid the subscription. Was advised that although purchased from them a refund was not allowed for Apps purchases unless the App had failed. Still not got the Premium service restored with little time tomorrow in order to contact technical support. Has anyone else had this problem and if so how did you get it restored promptly? All sorted Monday afternoon by Xbox tech support by giving a refund (unofficially?) which enabled me to re-subscribe. They eventually stated that there had been a breach on my subscription (didn't ask what that meant). They also said that the matter should have been sorted by MS sales. Thank you Xbox for getting me out of this nightmare!  Have now purchased a 30 day subscription to ensure all now working OK so that I will be more comfortable purchasing another annual option.

"I suppose it depends on what you mean by ""importing"".  PPT's never been able to handle SWFs on its own in the way it does WMF, EMF, PNG and other such importable formats.  If you mean that you inserted a Flash control to host the SWF, that's a different matter.   According to this web page, it still works.   Here's another page from PPT MVP Ellen Finkelstein that addresses versions of PPT through 2013; I don't imagine 2016 has changed especially.

"Hi,   Welcome to Microsoft Community.   I understand that you wanted to disable IP based search results from Bing. Basically this is a backend based configuration just like other websites and search engines. However you may override it from your end by properly selecting your appropriate market.   Selecting markets would give you different results based on local cultural norms and sensibilities, restrictions and laws of that particular country. For example, indexed results when US market is selected would be different from the results other countries or markets are selected like China or the Middle East. If the browser does not accept your Market selection, then you may need to allow cookies to remember your configuration.   Allowing Cookies in IE: 1. Open Internet Explorer. 2. Click Tools from the menu bar. 3. Choose Internet Options from the dropdown menu. 4. Click the Privacy tab. 5. Hit the Advanced button. 6. Make sure that the following options are checked:      a. Override automatic cookie handling.      b. Accept under First-party cookies.      c. Accept under Third-party cookies.      d. Always allow session cookies. 7. Click OK to close the Advanced Privacy Settings window. Select the Apply then OK buttons to close the Internet Options window.   I hope I have clear things out.

"Hi Brian  Thank you for your reply.  I ran the troubleshooter in step one, but the only problem that this identified was that the display was set too bright and which was automatically fixed.  I then used the commands in step two, which both ran in the command prompt successfully.  However, this does not appear to have affected the behaviour of the power meter.  I have noticed that despite the tablet being on charge for more than one hour, the keyboard battery charge has only moved from 6% to 7% in that time, which from my experience of how this previously charged, would be a very slow charging time.  I have also realised that despite the battery meter identifying that the keyboard battery is 'plugged in' and 'charging', the AC adapter that plugs into the mains electrical socket is cold, which would perhaps indicate that no actual charging is taking place.  However, the tablet battery is able to charge and charges quickly and fully.  TheEvan keyboard itself in little more than one year old and has not been used to excess, with it likely only having been charged a relatively small number of times.  I would therefore be surprised if the battery had failed.  Is it possible that in reality both batteries are fully charged, as evidenced by the cold AC adapter and that battery meter is displaying inaccurate information?

"BS yes that is correct. If all you are doing is Moving a Hard Drive from your old computer to your new computer you should not have to reactivate windows but that is what I get. contacting support on the phone they tell you that you need to reinstall windows 8 pro than reinstall media center ( free product key which is now invalid) reupgrade to 8.1 pro ( which at the time was appx 4 gig file free upgrade) . when the old hard drive was perfect in old computer but now that's its in a new computer its invalid. And that to use this product you need to purchase a new key for it. Their is no reason for a product that works in the old computer perfectly, should need a new key by just moving a hard drive. same product different computer. that is like saying well all the apps on your old smartphone you bought will have to re bought for your new smartphone. this is so wrong in so many ways.

"Hello, I work for a company that partners with universities to create interactive course content for online degree programs. Usually, we record lectures in-studio with a full crew, but on occasion, we have to record professors or guests lecturing over Powerpoint slides remotely. For quality control reasons, these sessions need to be done live on a video call between a producer and a professor/guest. In the past, we've had no problem using Skype (7.44) with Call Recorder (2.6.2) to output two separate files: – one of the professor's webcam, and – one of the professor's screenshare (of a Powerpoint deck, for example). However, with more recent versions of Skype (specifically those rolled out in June 2017), we seem to have lost the ability to record the guest's screen and webcam simultaneously.  Is this a feature that was phased out intentionally? Is there a workaround that might be possible with newer versions of Skype? In the meantime, we have phased back to the versions that work for our needs (Skype 7.44 and Call Recorder 2.6.2), and I have reached out to support at Call Recorder to see if this is an issue on their end. Any help or feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your help!

Thanks for the reply.  I realise they do this to try to persuade people to upgrade to Windows 10.  While I do have a Windows 10 licence for both my Win 7 and Win 8.1 laptops from that free upgrade offer I have found that neither laptop is 100% compatible with Windows 10.  There is no full compatible video driver available for the Windows 7 laptop and the Windows 8 laptop can't access wifi channel 13 and has poor sound quality when using Windows 10  Because of this I find it unfair that Microsoft expects you to upgrade to windows 10 to get edge. I have also found that feedback app in windows 10 to be useless because I and many other people have reported the graphics driver problem that effects older ATI Radeon mobility graphics card and have been totally ignored.,3,0.45556286936749246,0.8092374460825097,False,False,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3,0.6,543,60,59,True,True,False,False,0.102,0.813,0.085,-0.1761

BSOD error notes I've made: Driver overran stack buffer Kmode exception not handled Recource not owned Kernal security check failure Reference by pointer FLTMGR.sys CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED Bad pool caller NTFS.sys Page fault in nonpaged area DPC watchdog violation System thread exception not handled Safe mode is the only way to be able to use my system. The PC can't even remain stable for long enough to reinstall windows! Hardware-wise nothing  has been tweaked beyond how it came in the box. Here are my specs, in case it helps.Here is my report from System Information and here are my mini dumps . When this issue began Two days ago. These may or may not be related, but when playing PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) I got a system lock up accompanied by a plain screen of flat colour (which may actually be close to my theme's colour: dark red and an audio stutter/buzz). Hard power-down is required. As my best guess, this was the when the BSODs started. Recurring issue Yes. If I can get to Safe Mode is it fine though. I can't recall a BSOD in Safe Mode. Cause/Steps to recreate the issue Turn on PC and it'll happen almost instantly. Some BSODs happen before you even get into Windows. Crashes even happen during Windows install process. The only way to reinstall was to take the SSD out and install Windows using another PC before putting the SSD back into my box. Plugging something into USB will almost certainly BSOD it too. What I've tried so far to resolve the issue Win10's inbuilt memory test MemTest86 (8 passes) Tested RAM sticks individually chkdsk + scandisk Rebuild MBR System Restore (BSOD interrupted this) System Reset (can't do it sometimes, other times it BSODs) Startup Repair (BSOD during) Removed GPU and tried onboard GFX Removed all other components and tested successfully separately Updating all motherboard drivers and flashing BIOS Tested one other set of RAM on motherboard compatibility list and still got BSODs Ubuntu seemed to run fine off USB3 There may be more, sorry I've tried so much I've probably forgotten some. Everything seems to point to the motherboard being faulty but I've just got this gut feeling that because safe mode is stable it's not faulty. Before I send it off for RMA and potentially incur a cost for them not finding it faulty I thought I'd try one last time to find an expert who might be able to shine some light on this for me.

That is exactly the type of error that I'm trying to except and make the code continue.  A lot of the paragraphs do not have a third word so I only want to put a sentence into the tot_sent array if the sentence has a third word.  The best way to do this is through error handling but it is not working.  ***Post moved by the moderator to the appropriate forum category.***              ,1,1.0,0.8702654675962291,False,False,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.25,509,57,57,True,False,False,True,0.084,0.844,0.072,-0.3855

"We are using Office 2016 and have a Form that was created originally in Word .doc but has been saved/converted to .docx. I have one client that when he opens up that form it does not show the Text in description fields.  The computer in question is a Windows 7 Pro. If I login on that computer and open the form the Text is not there in the Field so it is not the users profile. If I go to my computer, go to his computer through file explorer and open up the form, the Text is there, so the file is not corrupt. Something is not right with the clients settings however I do not know where to start to figure that out.

"Hi NicholasHunt3,  Welcome to the Skype Community forum. I do understand the inconvenience you have faced. Let me assist you with this.   Your device audio settings might not be properly configured to work with Skype after the update. Here's what we can do.   Please compare your Windows sound settings with your Skype audio settings. To locate your Windows sound settings, choose Start → Control Panel → Sound or Sounds and Audio devices. (This path may differ on some computers with different operating systems and configuration setups, but your aim is to locate the Sounds and Audio Devices control panel.) Once done, open Skype, select Tools > Options > Audio settings, then in the Speakers drop-down choose the playback device you want to use. Make sure that the sound devices match. Otherwise, your audio input and output may not come through the headset/speaker.   Moreover, please check if your audio driver is up-to-date. If you're still having problems, Microsoft has a tool to automatically diagnose and fix audio problems.     Please let me know if you have other questions.

"Janet, Yes, I am changing the notes master in View tab - Notes Master.  I am on Office 365 and should have the most recent version. I don't have any pending updates. Version 15.37 is what the about box shows.  My guess is that there are some slides that were pasted in from various presentations and some how they kept their original formatting and won't change when Notes Master is changed. Some slides do seem to update to the new format while others don't. I have found some slides with multiple text boxes (on top of one another) so the bottom one (which isn't visible) is updated with some stray box on top of it in the old format.   Another oddity is that some slides (possibly originally created in Keynote) let me change the font but won't let me change formatting (bold, italic). Really weird.  I am plowing through this with my workaround but it would be swell if there was easy access to an ""Apply Notes Master"" command on every page like there used to be. (I think it was a right click to the list of commands.) The only reliable way to change the Notes formatting themselves is to cut the text, delete the text box, and go to Normal view and Paste Text Only which recreates the text box with the current Notes Master formatting. But this won't change the placement of the slide (which I have occasionally had to move or make smaller). Sometimes the only work around to fix that is to create a new slide, copy the slide elements to it and copy the notes. Thanks for anything you might be able to do to help in the future. I have a deadline so unfortunately, I have to muscle through this manually right now.

"Hello Michael,  Thank you for the response.  I definitely understand why you feel that way, but please be informed that since Skype has been acquired by Microsoft, the option to sign in to Skype using your Microsoft account is possible.  If you sign up using mobile number, your Skype name is: live(alphanumeric) called lightweight account and if you sign up using email, your Skype name is your email address. Thus, if you did not link your Skype and Microsoft account and you've signed in to Skype using your email address, Skype will create you an account with pre-determined Skype name.  You can link your Skype and Microsoft accounts to avoid the confusion from having two separate accounts. This way, you can also sign in to Skype using your email address/ Microsoft account without routing you to a different account.

" Bryan,  The main problem I see with the solution above is that most businesses do not have the capability for an iPhone or iPad to use AirPlay to connect to the projectors or TVs found in conference rooms, ballrooms, etc. where business people given PowerPoint presentations.  I think the best solution for any mobile device (iOS or Android) is to have PowerPoint running on a Windows or Mac PC, connected to the projector, and then have the mobile device connected via Bluetooth to the PC/Mac.   The reason this is important is that more customers are using TVs vs. projectors.  Normal laser pointers do not work on them.  Also, if you are in a larger room with multiple displays, the laser pointer cannot display on all screens.  I saw a person use the Android remote app today and it was impressive.

Thank you for the reply.  I do have a comment and question.  My PPT is only one slide.  I want to use it while teaching and only play parts of the audio file.  Microsoft says the Android version will play an audio file.  I have embedded 5 objects to the same audio file just playing different portions of it.  There will be no continuous play or playing across slides.  The audio does stop playing at the chosen time but will not start at the time I have chosen.  It starts at the beginning.   Does the Android version support playing audio that was created on Windows 10 using the Trim feature?
