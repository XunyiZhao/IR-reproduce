"Hello everyone, We have Office 365 installed on a 55"" touch screen monitor with an embedded computer. The computer is running Windows 7. We are running a power point file that has an embedded video. The power point is set up to be an interactive presentation to be used at trade shows. This week I had to change the the account for the Office 365 from a business version to a home version. So I ended up deleting the old version of Office 365 and then downloading & installing the home account version. Afterwards I discovered that the one embedded video that is in the presentation would stop at random places during playback. What you would see is the cursor show up in the middle of the video & the video would stop. Clicking on the video would start it right back up. We have tried forcing the cursor off the video, unplugging the mouse & the keyboard, nothing helps. This video had ran without problems before now.

"Hi Jennifer,   Welcome to Bing community!   I understand that you want your business to show up on the Bing listings.   If your listing is verified, it will typically take up to 14 days for business information to update on Bing. Listing search results and rankings can change due to a number of factors that are not directly in the control of the user. However, you may improve your results by keeping your listing up to date by adding specific and relevant categories, a detailed and relevant description of your business, photos, and professional contacts. Our recommendation is to apply as much business listing information as possible to improve your overall listing relevancy, which may potentially impact your listing rank.

"Hi Jenna56,  I should be able to shed some light on this, after having enjoyed this app for the past few months.  I've got a slightly different issue today, though should be able to help your query as not sure you've had the best responses so far.  I've been using the Photo's App on my Surface Pro 4 successfully for the past few months.  It works great - I just take photos on my mobile phone, they upload into One Drive, and then hey presto I return everytime to the Albums section in the Photo's App and I've got a nice neat album of quality photo's from the day.  Indeed, not all the photos are present - I noticed this and seems normal functionality.  I found this odd at first, though now I get how this works:  ""Collections"" stores all your photos - which is effectively your 'folders' ""Albums"" is Microsoft's way of digesting the photos in your folder/collection, to a user-friendly, readily viewable album folder.  The Photos App seems to cleverly apply some logic to: remove duplicate photo's, select the best photo's, identify a choice few photos from similar images, remove blurred images, remove poorly lit images.  What's is left seems to be the App's best attempt to start a great album for you, to summarise the photo's from the day.  In addition to this, it chooses a good album cover photo, and also applies the ""Enhance"" to enhance all the images in the Album.   The result (and ultimate benefit), is that by doing nothing, you can just open up your album and immediately have available a good album set to view yourself or show to others.  If you want *all* photo's just go to Collections - which is unfiltered.  So Albums starts off an album for you based on the photo's taken for that day.  I then 'optimise' the album by choosing ""Edit"" in the top right corner, then click + 'Add or Remove photos'.  The logic applied is excellent, although it doesn't always get all the photos you want, so I manually select/de-select photos as appropriate.  I have found this really useful, as when taking photo's I do have many duplicates and blurred ones - I also have 100's of photo directories, and going through each one is a) very time consuming and b) I don't like to delete photo's, so the Album is a useful ""view"" on photo's you want. I find it great for showing kids/parents.  In summary, it's normal functionality - just use Collections if you prefer all photos.  I'm no expert in this btw, this is just how I've been using it.  For info, I have a separate problem in that since the Aug 2016 Microsoft Windows 10 update, I have now lost all my albums ...",7,0.5768205059829066,0.8736294938967601,False,True,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,7,0.875,1744,167,154,False,False,False,False,0.027,0.833,0.141,0.9957

"So about a month ago my legacy Skype iOS version I'm using logged out and never logged back in, ""can't connect to skype"" being the error message (posted on here). The issue, I presume, is due to something server-side being taken down, while it is still hardcoded in the config of this legacy version (4.17.135).  Interestingly, a 4.18.15 (/ 8.1.0.47312) Skype build (iPad targeted, I believe, but has iPhone assets and works on iPhone) logs in as normal.  I figured if I could transfer the config from the iPad/working version, I can continue using 4.17.135. So far, the main (or so I thought) changes I spotted were in (primary)server in the per-account config.xml (s.gateway.messenger.live.com instead of bn2-s.gateway.messenger.live.com in 4.17.135), updout and SuperNode in shared.xml. However, inserting new values didn't do the trick. Surprisingly, just copying the <Credentials3> string from the account-specific config.xml of 4.18.15 logs you in automatically (due to the Default string in the config I guess), but if you log out it's the same error all over again and the string is removed, so a one-time solution.

NOT possible per your site (Unless of course there is a very small button or drop down buried deep and not logical to find on the SHARED map). If this is not possible (i.e., saving a shared map), then just say ""This unfortunately is not possible"".

Ronnie. Your answers are frustrating me. But I am not trying to be mean. Office doesn't crash every time ... who said that?  I said I save all the time to your suggestion to save. Why do I save all the time? I work with very large files and sometimes it crashes when multiple large PPTs are open ...because Mac laptops have max 16gigs of RAM. PowerPoint has gotten better but there are still some large files support issues...likely around memory paging if I had to guess.  You shouldn't tell me it never destroys my files. It did. Somewhere a handler didn't do its job. After all...being able to run a PowerPoint file repair on Windows to get to the XML says something. The fact the market for such tools exist something else...and the OS kernel didn't  go down ...  I just needed help with this issue.

"Since the drive is apparently full you need to do some emergency cleanup. Windows has been traditionally very ""cranky"" when it is low on drive space.

Some web sites don't work in Chrome, but look I left Safari because some don't work in Safari and I'm not a big fan of Firefox. As luck would have it, one of the pages I want to open won't work on Chrome. So I can hyperlink the image that I want to open the page to launch Firefox application - find so be it. But then I have to load that page and that isn't as smooth as I would like when presenting. So what I use right now is to hyperlink the URL and it opens in Chrome but there is a Chrome plug-in that lets you open the page in Firefox at the click of a button. Good but not great. Is there a way to just get PowerPoint, without VBScript or whatever scripting it uses, to and open a page in a specific browser. I thought perhaps I could do this via the URL, I can with the Microsoft browser so I was told, but haven't seen a cleaner way to my problem.

"Hi, Julie! Thank you for your question, and Happy Saturday!   If you were to use all three match types with that keyword, the system would have some conflict deciding on what to serve. Generally speaking, the system usually goes for the most exact/specific match to the query, but there have been quite a few times where the system doesn't display an ad because of the multiple match type conflict. Therefore, it would be in your best interests to decide on 1 or 2 match types instead of all 3.  Now, choosing the right match type depends on your advertising goal. If you are looking for as much traffic as possible, even if the query may not be 100% what you are advertising, I would select the broad match type. If your objective is to draw towards a certain user, but don't want to limit the keyword too much, then select the phrase match type. But, if you only want your ad to serve if a user types in your keyword exactly, with nothing else in the query, your best option is exact match.  You can find out more about match types in the following links:  - What are keyword match types, and how do I use them?  - Using broad match and broad match modifier  - Keyword match options  If you have any other questions or concerns about this, feel free to reply to this response, chat in, or contact our Support Team for your region.

"Hi,  I can certainly understand your frustration. However, make sure the right network adapter is being used. Some computers might have multiple network adapters. For example, if you bought a new desktop computer and during the purchase you upgraded to a different network adapter, you most likely have an onboard network adapter (a network adapter built onto your computer's motherboard) as well as a secondary network adapter inserted into an available slot in the computer. You can verify this by looking for two network ports on the back of your computer. (Network ports look like large phone jacks.) Laptops normally have just one network port unless you’re using a USB network adapter.  Follow these steps to check and set the correct network adapter as default.  To set the default network adapter:  1. Open Network Connections by swiping in from the right edge of the screen, tapping Search (or if you're using a mouse, pointing to the upper-right corner of the screen, moving the mouse pointer down, and then clicking Search), entering Network Connections in the search box, tapping or clicking Settings, and then tapping or clicking View network connections. 2. If multiple network adapters are installed, the default adapter will have a check mark and be labeled ""Default"". 3. If the correct network adapter is listed as disabled, press and hold or right-click it, and then tap or click Enable. 4. If the wrong network adapter is listed as the default, press and hold or right-click the correct adapter, and then tap or click Set as Default Connection.  Make sure the network adapter is enabled:  1. Open Network Connections by swiping in from the right edge of the screen, tapping Search (or if you're using a mouse, pointing to the upper-right corner of the screen, moving the mouse pointer down, and then clicking Search), entering Network Connections in the search box, tapping or clicking Settings, and then tapping or clicking View network connections. 2. Press and hold or right-click the network adapter, and then tap or click Enable.  You might be asked for an admin password or to confirm your choice.   Note: If the network adapter isn’t working properly, you might need to download and install the latest driver for it. (If you received an installation disc with the network adapter or with your computer, the driver might also be on the disc.)  Run the following trouble shooters mentioned in the below link:  a. Network Troubleshooter. b. Internet connections Troubleshooter. c. Network adaptor Troubleshooter.  http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/cant-connect-to-network#1TC=windows-8  You can also refer to the Microsoft Community link mentioned below for further reference.  http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/network-connection-problem-help#network-problems=windows-81&v1h=win81tab1&v2h=win7tab1&v3h=winvistatab1&v4h=winxptab1  For further queries, please feel free to contact us.

"Hello again,  thanks for the feedback.   The ""custom delimiter"" option gives you the tool to determine what character is used as the delimiter in your data set. It does NOT cover the possibilities of mixed delimiters in a data source. Mixing delimiters is not good practice and should be discouraged. The custom delimiter in Power Query is actually quite powerful, because you can define a delimiter that contains more than one character, thus saving additional steps to clean up the resulting data. So, the delimiter could be a string like ""  -  "" (i.e. space, space, dash, space, space) and Power Query will happily slice the data when it finds that string, whereas importing a file with the old tools only allowed for ONE character to be the delimiter.  But the delimiter must always be the same throughout the data set. That's the whole idea of a delimiter.   Files from multiple sources can easily be handled with Power Query. Each file may need different handling for delimiters etc. Take each file at a time and determine its delimiter. Then combine the results of different queries as required.",4,0.5073335781530729,0.8677835849335601,False,True,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,4,1.0,808,81,72,False,True,False,True,0.018,0.915,0.066,0.8148

"THAT, was very nice of you to reply so quickly.  It sounds as if (based on my reading of your post) that I have everything enabled correctly. (A good thing.)  By the way ... It's not JUST the mail app tile that I am unable to find documentation for. I'm having the same issue with the MSN News, and Store apps as well. Plenty of ""how to use"" documentation available but little or no mention of the tiles.  Here's why I ask.  I recently reinstalled Windows 10 home. And everything, as far as I know, is running perfectly.  I did notice however, that the live mail tile ""seems"" to behave a bit differently than I remember it (Before the reinstall.)  IE: Used to be (methinks). If I had 10 unanswered emails, the number ""10"" would appear on the tile. If an additional email arrived, 10, would turn to 11. And it would stay at ""11"", until I opened mail and clicked on one of the 11 never opened emails. If I clicked on one(of the emails to read it) and then ended mail, the live tile would now say ""10"". I always thought that the number on the tile represented the number of ""unread"" emails in the ""In"" box. But due to the lack of documentation on the tile, I could have simply made that up.  Now (after my reinstall of Windows 10), it seems to behave differently.  As a test, I sent myself a couple of emails from my phone. The number on the Mail tile changed to ""2"". (Good, so far.) If however, I left it that way for a period of time, the number ""2"" will disappear and be replaced by no number at all. But if I open the mail app, there are indeed 2 unread emails (from my phone).  So, before crying ""wolf"" (or worrying that my reinstall of WIndows 10 went bad in some way), I thought I would try to locate and read how the mail live tile is SUPPOSED to behave.  Maybe, it is behaving correctly and either my memory is faulty (Wouldn't be the first time) or now that Windows has been reloaded and updated, I find the Win10 mail tile (by design) simply works differently. And that OKay with me. I just would like to know how it is SUPPOSED to work.  Hence my looking for documentation.  Did I write that correctly ? ..... Yes. Yes, I think I did.  Thanks once again for your time, response to my question about finding documentation.  I'll continue my search and if I ever find any, I'll do my best to update this post.

After 2 calls, I started saying that I am also recording this call from my side and after couple of minutes they disconnected my call without saying any word. I called 5 representatives in 3 days and the result is same. And most important thing is those guys did not sound as representatives, their language and way of talking is different.

"Hi, I am creating a document with many vector images involving numerous effects. I draw vector images in inkscape, and then convert them in EMF format for use in MS Word. The problem is that many effects like gradient effect and clipping are lost in the process of conversion and the EMF illustration is no longer comparable to original SVG image. The use of vector image is very important and it is very unlikely that I would use a raster image (unless the illustration used is a picture). I've searched the internet for questions asking solutions to same problem, many people recommended the use of power point to create image and then save them as EMF. I have no problem doing that until I can perform all the basic operation that can be done in inkscape (effects like clipping and masking etc.) and there is a clear documentation available on-line for use of MS Drawing tools in Power point.

"Mmmmm yes, seems strange as I get it to the same numbers with my 10 computer, my 7 computer and my android 4.4 (new KitKat netbook!

Since that time, certain numbers, mostly French in my case, and as regular as clockwork get a hissing white noise between the dialling and response. As I stated I think that it may be something to do with the hand shake as certain exchanges seem to be too quick to respond.  I had the following email:- Service Request <1349432902>  and I am with Microsoft Global Escalation Services.

"Hello Friends, I need help on how to proceed :- My Dell laptop purchased few years back was provided with Windows 7 pro unlicensed version. To have licensed version of Microsoft Windows 7 Pro installed, I now purchased software online. Microsoft Windows 7 Pro licensed version is successfully downloaded. But I do not know how to proceed ... 1. On starting downloaded software it directs to CD burning. This CD burning process failed although I attempted with different makes - Sony, Maxell etc. The error message reads ""speed does not match"". So my queries are  Is it advisable to save Microsoft Windows 7 Pro in form of CD only ? OR Can download 2nd copy also be preserved on portable HD ? What is solution for this CD burning problem ? 2. How do I uninstall the old unlicensed version & install to activate new purchased licensed version ? Kindly provide step by step instructions so that my data stored is safe & not lost.

"Not sure this will work for you, as these bing apps seem to operate differently for each user. Try this:  Open bing news > right-click anywhere > left-click Customize (bottom left) > left-click red-X on item to be removed.

"Thanks Michael,  Part of my problem with this was just not understanding how it's supposed to show up when it's working. Now that I understand that better, I can see that it works, but only if I use the method I mentioned to reset it for each instance of use - that is to toggle the slider from On to Off to On again in Win 10 PC Settings > Gaming >Game Bar That seems to be the only way I can get it to work. Whether that's intended function or not ... it works and I can live with that for now. I'd go to a third party app b4 spending any more time on this.   The other part is that when accessing the Game bar menu I can make changes, but for some reason it still locks up the screen and I have to restart Explorer to get everything on my desktop back. But when I reopen Game Bar the changes have been saved so it is technically working, but with the Explorer restart glitch. So 50% success with this but I don't want to waste any more time on this. I will revisit this after WIndows 10's next major update where I'll choose to reinstall the OS, rather than slipstream the updates.

"3/4/2015 Andrea, I installed the latest Win8 x64 driver for my printer. That helped, but not completely. I suspected that the problem was with the website and I was right. In IE11 the F12 tools have evolved quite nicely. The various help pages insist that the developer test early and often. That apparently not done when the print css was developed. I was surprised to find that IE7 was the default emulation. Even changing the emulation to IE8 eliminated the issue with the pagination. I looked at the source and found this in the <head> <meta http-equiv=""X-UA-Compatible"" content=""IE=7"" />  That restricts Internet Explorer to the document modes of IE7. Now, to put it into perspective, in 2010 MS issued a warning that support for IE6 and 7 was ending. Most larger sites phased out support for IE7 several years ago. Since the meta tag above is only followed by IE, it makes sense why Firefox printed correctly.  I did some elementary troubleshooting that the site developers should have done.

I have no experience with Windows 8, so I'm not sure exactly how it works--what features may be comparable to the desktop, Start menu, and Taskbar in Windows 7--but if you can't find a Word shortcut in any of those places (or their equivalents), then you'll need to find the Word executable and create a new shortcut.   I'm clearly out of my depth here, so I'm going to point you to another page that seems to offer help on how to do this: http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/create-windows-8-taskbar-shortcuts-for-your-favori.html",2,0.27329083371435664,0.900193967475546,False,False,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2,0.2857142857142857,520,60,60,False,False,False,False,0.059,0.867,0.074,0.4895

"I'm looking to do a little media distribution in my house and believe the Windows 7 will give me the ability to do what I want, but I'm not sure whether I want to use media center or media player or some combo of the two. Here's what I want to do.  I have my media sitting on a windows home server and I want to play it in another room of my house. One option is to use another PC with media center at the place where I want to play it and let that run through the TV, but I really hate the idea of being forced to turn my TV on just to pick what music I want to listen to, this seems overkill. So what I had in mind was a PC with a touch screen that I could wall mount. This would allow me to browse media using the touch interface. The next thing becomes how to control the media from other places in the house. What I really like is the ability in media player to do the ""Play To"" thing, this is great, because I could if I wanted to keep the PC that's close to the amp and TV headless with no display and use 'Play to' to control it from any other PC in the house. My only problem is that then I loose the 10 ft interface of media center.  Any thoughts on being able to do a remote media center session from any other PC, so I'd like to be able to mount a big 20"" touchscreen PC (like an HP Touchsmart) on the wall in my kitchen and use the touch interface to control the media center by the TV. If I could do this from any PC, then I could in theory do this from any PC device in the house.  Thoughts on how I could pull this off would be welcome.  thanks.",1,0.9999999999999998,0.9923490681924334,False,False,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1,0.25,957,96,94,True,True,False,False,0.057,0.805,0.139,0.9767

If there is now no way to set up a custom welcome message then this is a useless service and Google gives me this and more for free so why pay Skype for it?

"Susan,  Thanks for trying to help.  I applied the modifications you listed but am still not hearing my voice recording during the Skype Echo test.  I'm trying to find a contact who is online, at the moment, but because I was failing this test when I first noticed my contact couldn't hear me, I'm reasonable sure that , as the recording says, there is something wrong with my audio settings..  My computer is Windows Vista, version 6.0 with Service Pack 2 and the Skype version is 7.36.0.150.  I understand that Vista is no longer supported and about a week ago when I received a notice to update Skype, that was when the problems appeared to start.  I actually contacted a technician by phone who loaded and installed the update.  I believe the Echo test was working at that time, however, but I do remember I was not able to connect with one of my contacts, as none were online at that time.  I tried to find a ""live"" technician last night, but was unable to find a technical support phone number for Skype.  Do you have a good number for their technical support office?  Thanks for trying, I do realize most of the problems are arising due to an obsolete operating system and the very slow download speeds provided to our neighborhood by Verizon.  We only get a little over 3 mps.  I've been forced to continue using my Vista desktop and laptop since my new Windows 10 desktop and laptop take up too much bandwidth and shut me out of the internet after a few minutes.

"It sounds like you're referring to the Bing app that appears by default on the Windows 8 Start screen, correct? It's possible that the app was just unpinned from your Start screen. The first thing you might try is to right-click on the Start screen or swipe up from the bottom of the screen and click the All Apps view. Here you should see a comprehensive list of all apps installed on your device. If you find Bing here, then you can just tap+hold to pin it to the Start screen again.  It's also possible that the app was accidentally uninstalled. Bing is a Windows Store (Metro) app,  not a conventional Windows program, so it cannot be managed through the Control Panel. Instead, you should check the Windows Store. Just open the Store app, search for Bing, and it will tell you whether or not it's already installed on your device. If not, you should be able to reinstall it from there. It's a free app, so that should take care of it.  If you're using the Windows 8.1 Preview (or the RTM), be advised that the Bing app no longer exists in this release. The Bing app will not appear in the Windows 8.1 Store. Instead, Bing has been integrated directly into the Search hero, which is accessible from the Search charm on the Charms bar. When you swipe from the right side of the screen (or press Win key + C), tap Search, and enter a search term while searching everywhere, your results will automatically incorporate results from Bing. There's no longer a need for a separate app.  Of course if you prefer a classic search experience, you can still pin the Bing web page to the Start Screen. Just open IE, go to www.bing.com, tap Favorites, and then tap Pin to Start.

"Thank you Susan for your reply!  Huh, I must admit, it was not very intuitive. It also means that I have to hold the ""record"" button (how would I know that it is at all a video record button?!)  Don't you think that it is quite awkward to be compelled to hold the button during the recording? How am I supposed to record a video message if I want to put the phone on something to be able to record myself in full height? Say, to show avnew outfit or something else?  I've just tried to follow your instructions and also discovered that the length of the video is very short now. From three minutes it's been dropped to something about 30 seconds.  Thus, I wonder, why the update degrades the features in the app? From now on you have to hold the button instead of just tapping it and the length of the video is decreased by factor six.  Shouldn't the app update improve the features instead?

"Hello Patricia,  It seems that you are having an issue connecting your Facebook account to the Bing Bar due to script errors and there is no option to allow connection of Bing to Facebook.  If the only sign of a problem is the error message, and if the websites are working, you can probably ignore the error. Also, if you are referring to the “Allow” button, please be advised that clicking on the “Okay” button is as good as allowing Bing connection to Facebook.  Let me walk you through on how you can connect your Facebook account to the Bing Bar even if you encounter script error messages:  1) Sign in with your Facebook account in the Bing Bar.  2) When the ""Bing would like to access your email address, messages and friend requests"" dialog appears and a Script error that says ""An error has occurred in the script on this page"" overlaps the dialog, click on ""No"" button to stop running that script.  3) Click ""Okay"" button to proceed.  4) The page stating ""Bing would like to post to your friends on your behalf"" will appear next. Again, click ""No"" and then the ""Okay"" buttons to proceed.  5) The following page will appear next, ""Bing would like to manage your messages and manage your notifications."" Like the previous steps, you must stop running the script on the page by clicking the ""No"" button. Click ""Okay"" to proceed.  Once done, you should be able to connect your Facebook account to the Bing Bar successfully.

"Right sussed this out now.. :)  You need to use a file recovery tool like the one at www.recuva.com if you don't have a backup, as the files will have been deleted. We discovered the emails had actually been backed up by MemeoBackup for this PC. We recovered the files and then searched within the recovered items for files like *.eml and they were all there. In Windows Live Mail the user went into File> Import.. and chose emails and browsed to the recovered emails folder. For some reason it said it was importing the emails, and although the missing account reappeared along with all it's folders the emails themselves didn't turn up so we highlighted the *.eml files and dragged and dropped the emails into the folders. I've no idea why the import didn't work, I was trying to fix it over the phone so I couldn't look too much into it but if anyone else has the same trouble this fixed it for us.

If you prefer not to be included in search and suggestions, then you can opt out here. Opting out will make you unsearchable in Skype, but people may still contact you if you have synced your address book or through matching via phone number, email address, or Skype Name.   1. Sign in to Skype on the website. 2. Scroll down to Settings and preferences > Edit Profile.  3. Scroll down to Profile settings > Discoverability. Make sure the box is mark check. This will help people to find and add you on Skype. 4. Sign out and signed back in to Skype app and try searching your Skype ID.  Hope this works, let me know if you need further assistance.

"Hello Christopher,   If you are referring to the profile picture that displays when you are in Bing, julientremblay17Bruce is right. It synchronizes depending on how you connect with Bing and there are two possible ways on how you can do this. Here are the steps that you can perform to get your profile picture in Facebook or Microsoft account displayed in Bing:  1) Go to http://www.bing.com  2) Click on the Sign in down arrow icon then select on how you wish to connect to Bing.    a. Connect to Facebook    b. Connect to Microsoft account  3) If you select connecting to Facebook, just enter the email address and password that you are using to sign in to your Facebook account.  Likewise, sign in with the email address and password you are using to access your Hotmail/Outlook.com inbox when connecting to Microsoft account.  Both of which will redirect to the Bing homepage after. However, the profile picture set up on your Facebook/Microsoft account will not synchronize with Bing right away.  4) To see your Facebook/Microsoft account profile picture in Bing, just search for anything in Bing search box. Your picture will then appear at the top right end of the search results page.  Hope this helps!

I can actually send emails using email2 (and can include the code you send to email3). I just can't receive emails to the email2 account and cleaning up the email2 mailbox will take too much time.

I merged the accounts and I'm now able to log in.

"According to the previous answer, Skype provides contact names with numbers that the contact themselves updates in their profile. We cannot manipulate the numbers because they are being pulled from other people's profiles.   It's like opening a phone book. You don't provide the numbers, the people and businesses that belong to those numbers do. So if you change your phone numbers in your personal Skype profile, it will update everyone's Skype contact list.   This is GOOD if you would rather have up to date information from your list.  This is BAD if you prefer (like I do) not to see every single number from every contact that you'll never use or care about.

This problem was brought up by another user in the Windows Phone forum. I'm having the same problem and another user was able to produce the results on a few other phones. The problem is with Bing image search. When you click on a thumbnail in the first group of pictures everything is fine but when you scroll down past the first recommended searches to the next group of pictures clicking on a thumbnail takes you to a random image. We were told to post the problem in this forum.

"Hi,  You can sync the information with Health Vault  You can export and save your health information in two ways: as a spreadsheet or as a CCR or CCD or HTML file. A spreadsheet or HTML page is handy if you want a copy of your information on paper, or you’d like to bring a printout to your doctor’s office.The CCR and CCD formats are used to transfer patient health information between clinical systems. To save health information as a spreadsheet: Creating your own CCR or CCD with information from your HealthVault record is easy, but keep in mind that CCRs and CCDs don’t support all types of health information, so they won’t necessarily contain everything in your record. If you’re planning on sending the file to a health care provider or clinical system, make sure you’re using the format (CCR or CCD) they recommend. To save information in your HealthVault record as a CCR or CCD or HTML file:   HealthVault has a list of Apps available designed to do things like help you organize your family’s medical records, lose weight, manage a chronic health condition, track or improve your fitness, stay prepared for emergencies, and more. https://account.healthvault.com/us/en/Directory?target=Applications",2,0.19075675652968382,0.9618411478840262,True,False,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2,0.4,883,79,73,False,False,False,False,0.016,0.794,0.191,0.9882

"Hi! I have an Excel spreadsheet that I want to use to calculate/sum time. I have four columns (also a screenshot is posted below!); 1. Time Start 2. Time End 3. Total DAY Hours 4. Total NIGHT Hours  So what I do is that I put a time in time start column and a time in time end column. So in the day column, if I do ""Time End - Time Start"" (using cell references obviously), I succuessfully get my total hours/minutes. However, my problem is that all of that time goes inside the day column...So how can I get Excel to put any hours/time AFTER 7PM and UNTIL 5AM to be inside the NIGHT Column?  Here is an image of my spreadsheet; as you can see, I was testing it, it works though, but it cares for all time as day (obviously as I put it in day, but I would like to divide this!)  So for example, say if I put Start Time as: 3:00PM and End Time as 9:00PM. What I would like to happen is that, any time before 6PM is in day so I would want the sum to be; 3 Hours in DAY Column and then the remaining 3 Hours in Night (as any hours after 6PM is declared as night). Or if there is no time before 6PM, it all should simply be in night/vice-versa.  I'm quite a newbie so, I'd like some help!

"<<  Do you know if this has been reported as faults to Microsoft using a Microsoft Premier Support agreement. >>  No, I don't.  Although I sometimes report things through the mechanisms available to me, I'm not a company paying a lot for support, and my personal experience of almost all avenues to Microsoft support was almost always very, very bad, so I try to spend as little time as possible interacting with any of them. Part of the problem is that when there is no response from them, you cannot even tell whether a problem has already been discovered or reported. It wastes everyone's time, not just theirs. I generally only report stuff that appears to have changed accidentally or which looks to me as if it is not going to require a major effort. To be honest it would surprise me if such the various shortcomings to do with controls/SharePoint had not been reported by people who use that stuff day in, day out - there certainly seems to have been an outcry when InfoPath was deprecated.  Some of the problems might be perceived as design faults, but I think in many cases it is probably more to do with the fact that the Word team introduced content controls at a certain point in SharePoint's development and there has been some ossification.  OTOH if you have a good experience of Microsoft support, it may be worth your while reporting stuff that you come across that doesn't work as you might expect!

I've reported this issue to the system admins in case it needs to be rolled back (if it can).  Userforms are the worst place for VBA to fail because it's the user interface.

"Thanks for your response. I appreciate your time.  I did some things in the meantime, which I'll get to.   There were no error codes when I tried to open the apps, but when I restarted the computer, I got the following two error codes at various stages: 80004001 and oxc0000034. The thing with the ""add account"" was when I was trying to add a new account (following advice on some discussion page) on the hunch that, as you mention, the user profile issue was behind it. Clicking on ""add account"" button resulted in a flicker, similar to that resulting when I tried to open some of the malfunctioning apps. Now that issue too is normal.  Basically, it was not opening windows for a time, indicating a boot problem at one point, but after a few re-tries, it did open. By that time, I'm nervous, and decided, coolly, and after some deliberation, to restore the system. I've done that, and all of the apps are back. Everything seems fine, except that, on restarting again, I again got sent to the page that indicated that windows would not open. I again restarted once, and it spent some time with the windows updates, and now everything looks normal.   That failure to open windows on initial try occurred just prior to restoring the system, and just after, and I've never had that problem before in the two years with this computer.

"Without any details it's hard to tell from a screen shot, but my guess is that the image was inserted & Scaled to fit the Slide Size at the time. The Slide Size then was changed to A3, in which case there was a prompt about ""Scaling"" the image & Yes was selected.  The program did exactly what it was supposed to do. The reason for the ""straps"" is that the original Slide Size & A3 have different aspect ratios. The result is that the image was scaled but was scaled proportionately in order to avoid distortion... That's why it spans the width but not the height of the slide.  In these examples the slide on the left illustrates the image scaled to fit the default Widescreen size, the slide on the right is the same slide after changing to A3:    IOW, changing the slide size after adding content is like having a custom tailored suit made, then gaining/losing 25 pounds & growing 3 inches taller.

"Earlier this year I started noticing that certain keys wouldn't always take. I would be typing and would realize that the shift key or space had not performed its function. But if I pressed deliberately and firmly, it would work. Over time it seemed to get worse, or perhaps I just noticed it more. The right shift key and space tend to be the worst, but 4 on the number row and sometimes numbers on the keypad also do not want to work. The problem is random and sporadic. Sometimes so bad I have difficulty even typing out a short message. Other times I can use the computer for days with minimal issue. The Toshiba troubleshooter and some online sources advise uninstalling the keyboard driver and restarting the computer. I have done this a number of times. Sometimes it seems like it may help for a little while, but the problem always comes back. I'm out of warranty, so they refuse to let me even talk to tech support without charging me. In the list of drivers for my computer, they do not have a keyboard driver. I've seen indications that some people have trouble with conflicts with a Lenovo/Synaptics driver. My touchpad is ELAN, not Synaptics, so that isn't it (although I did try uninstalling and reinstalling the touchpad driver anyway, just in case). I booted Ubuntu from a flash drive and had no problems with the keyboard. Again, with any test it's hard to be sure, given the random and sporadic nature of this issue, but it seems pretty sure that it's a software problems that only developed after the Windows 10 Creator Update. Based on other tips I found online, I have tried removing the battery and waiting for several minutes before starting the computer, and plugging in a USB keyboard, typing and removing the USB keyboard. The problem always comes back. It seems my next course of action may be to factory reset the computer and hope that fixes it--although not only is that a major hassle, but I wonder if, once the computer is restored and updates, the problem will not simply return. Does anyone know where I can find a Satellite S50-C keyboard driver? Toshiba has let me down and I can't seem to find anything. I've found a few Windows 7 drivers for older Toshiba laptops, but I need something explicitly designed to work on Windows 10... ideally something for my model of laptop.

If the person you're calling is not initiating screen sharing, but your screen is still being shared, I strongly recommend you to completely uninstall and reinstall Skype to reset its configuration settings.   To completely uninstall, and then reinstall Skype for Mac: Important: If you’d like to keep your chat and call history, skip step #3.  *By default, the Library folder is hidden in Mac OS X v10.7 “Lion” and higher. To find your Library folder, open Finder and, from the menu bar, select Go, press and hold the option key, and then select Library.

Well mine had the same problem that vertical scroll was not working:  Fix: The mouse had so much rubbish in it that the laser counting the wheel clicks lost connection. Meaning - You have to open the mouse up and pick out all the hairs and dust balls in it and it works like new.   Basically you need a thin plastic tool or anything pointy to remove the top cover of the mouse and a set of Torx 8 screwdrivers to finish the job. Remove the rubbish with tweezers and put back together.

"Hey Mitchell at home,   Windows Fax and Scan works with built-in and external fax modems but isn't designed to work with stand-alone fax machines or multifunction printers with fax capabilities.   Some printer manufacturers might offer drivers that allow your printer to function like a fax modem with Windows Fax and Scan.   For your product G85, there is no separate driver available. It runs on the inbuilt driver that's included in Windows 7. As such it's unlikely that the your printer can make use of the Windows Fax and Scan feature.

By signing in to your old account on the Skype for Windows 10 app or try to use the Skype for Windows Desktop (classic version), because there is an option there to import contacts. Here, let me show you (I am going to teach you the 2nd option).  First, download and install the Skype classic version or also known as Skype for Windows Desktop:  https://www.skype.com/en/download-skype/skype-for-windows/downloading/  Here is the how to back it up:  If you did all those steps, you can either sign in to the new version of Skype for Windows 10 using your new account now or you can also stick with the old classic Skype version.  For source and reference, please go to this link below:  -          How do I transfer contacts from one Skype account to another?  I hope the above steps help resolve the issue you are experiencing.

I use Bing search quite frequently and sometimes I am not signed in to my Microsoft account. However I can see reward points accumulating for the searches I am doing. Now if at that point I log in on the bing.com page with Microsoft account the points accumulated till then by searching anonymously doesn't get added to my account bing rewards balance. Is that how this is supposed to work? Meaning you lose the points accumulated by using bing anonymously or should those points get added to the overall bing rewards balance? Has anyone else experienced the same? ,1,1.0,0.8070624915028954,True,True,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1,0.3333333333333333,405,40,34,True,False,False,False,0.025,0.877,0.097,0.829

" Hi, Jeffrey Mcvicker  To explain a different way, Skype call subscriptions cannot be shared amongst several Skype accountholders.  A subscription is dedicated to the account that the subscription was purchased on.  There is no way to share a single subscription.   Will it cover my three cell phones with Verizon?  My wife, daughter, and I have separate Skype accounts, however we are bundled together with Verizon.... Therefore, the answer to your original question is, ""No."" That your Verizon wireless plan includes three numbers is not related to, and has no connection with, any Skype accounts.  Skype does not have a ""friends and family"" feature, whereby rate plans, credit, text messaging, and call minutes can be shared in an account structure such as you, your wife, and daughter have in place with Verizon.  Some of the cellular service providers offer this, however Skype subscriptions, credit, and paid features have always been and continue to be set up for purchase and use on only one account - the account used to purchase the subscription, paid feature, or credit.

"Hi Jeffrey,  Our hope is that Bing will fix this - which is why we've asked for help in this Microsoft forum focused on Bing.  Although we have reached out to many groups / people it seems that nobody knows anybody who is able to actually fix this error made by Bing. We have requested help:  If you know of somebody who we can speak with at Bing we would like to speak with them.  The first person we spoke with at Bing Ads said the only way to get this changed might be by sending a ""cease and desist"" letter to Microsoft's legal department. It's disappointing if that is what it will take to fix this egregious error.  As I said yesterday I am going to wait a couple more days before acting again.

"I have been using Skype on my iPhone for many years without issue.  I also use it on my desktop.  This morning it asked me to sign in again (I suspect it updated) so I did and then it asked for my birthday.  I entered the year incorrectly.  Now Skype wants me to get a parent to allow me to use it (even though I'm using it on my desktop right now and have been using it on my phone for several years).  I went to the site it suggested account.microsoft.com and tried to add myself as a family member, but it says I already am a family member and there are no others. I updated my birthday in the Profile and that worked.  I tried deleting the app from my phone and even powering down for a few minutes then reloading and the same thing happens. I tried chatting with Microsoft support and they said, ""not my problem"" and directed me to a link that doesn't work. I tried chatting with Skype support and they said that 10am PST time is not part of their working hours. So, I'm trying here.  I've wasted about two hours trying to get this to work again.  Is there any way to fix it without losing my account.  I'm afraid to log off on my desktop in case it won't let me back there either.

They were all set to superscript in a small font.  Reopening, they are now Tahoma size 11, without superscript.

"Hello, Please forgive that I have asked this in another forum already, but I have received no responses there, and it has been out there for several weeks now. My hope is that maybe someone in this forum possibly has some ideas? I have been trying a few different things, and have done some research, but haven't yet found an answer to this question.  I have a total of 71 Workbooks with 2 tabs each, and they all need to be set up for printing. While I have set everything up for printing as best I could, some of them print out really small.  I'll provide an example. I've set the page breaks manually for all of these. One sheet/tab has the following:  A1:I30 that needs to print as page 1. A31:F64 needs to print as page 2. A65:F88 needs to print as page 3. A89:H135 needs to print as page 4. A136:G167 needs to print as page 5. A168:J202 needs to print as page 6. A203:I239 needs to print as page 7. A240:G264 needs to print as page 8.  Now, that's only one tab, and literally every tab has different ranges for each page.  The challenge is that when everything is adjusted to fit the largest area, the percentage shrinks for everything.  Is there a way to make each manually created page on this one tab (as described above) print as a different percentage for each manually created page? (So that each range above prints at a different percentage?) So, for example (and I'm using random percentages here for illustration purposes), if say the defined range that makes page 8 could print as 100% and fit on one page, but page 6 maybe needs to be 40% to fit on one page, and say page 2 could fit at 85% for one page, is this possible to accomplish?  Note: Everything needs to remain on the one tab.  So, right now with those above ranges for this example, all pages print at 40% when not all pages otherwise would not need to print out that small; the only reason all pages print out at 40% now is because of accomodating for the largest area (manually created page). (Note: I have also tried setting print areas manually as well and that didn't seem to make a difference.)

"Hi all, I have a skype number that we use for our office. Our thought process was that a Skype number would be handier, since there are three of us and we're often out of the office. That way we wouldn't miss calls. However, we are often finding that we miss calls anyway. We have a mac laptop each (running latest copy of skype) and iPhone (running latest copy of skype), and we find that when a call comes in, sometimes one of them will ring, sometimes two or more, but sometimes none of them will, despite being signed in. I can look at Skype on my phone, which will then update and tell me I have three missed calls. I cannot seem to get to the bottom of what is causing this. Is it because we have too many devices/people logged into the same account at the same time? Or is this an inherent problem within Skype itself? Should I only run Skype on the phone perhaps, and sign out if we're not the one 'marked as watching the phone'. No idea. Having recently lost a contract because we missed an important call I'm at the point of cancelling Skype and reverting to a landline, even though I know we'll miss calls if nobody is there. I may have to pay someone to sit in an empty office just to take the one or two calls a day we get.

"Attempt to find the Bitlocker Recovery Key. If you printed it out, look through your personal paperwork. If you saved it on a computer or another drive, do a search for files with ""Bitlocker"" in the name. If you think you might have written the password down then you can look for that too.  If you are unable to find the recovery key then you have two remaining options. One is to try and crack the Bitlocker password. If you did things properly this won't work - the whole *point* of Bitlocker is it can't be cracked - but if you used a weak password it might. It's not a topic I know about in detail and it probably shouldn't be discussed on Microsoft Answers anyway.  The second is to run a data recovery tool on any other computers or drives you have, and hope that you or your programs saved copies of the files on there in the past.

However, I am afraid to tell you that the only other way to use Skype on your Mac is to update it to at least Mac OS X 10.9 or higher. Due to a change in Skype infrastructure moving from peer to peer to the cloud, certain Skype platforms and devices will no longer work.   We want to create the best possible app experience for our Skype users which means we have to make some changes along the way. These decisions are hard to make, but will enable us to focus our efforts on transitioning Skype from a peer-to-peer video and chat app to a modern, mobile friendly cloud architecture.  You can check our support site to find out which devices and operating systems Skype will support in the future. Please let us know if you have questions.

"Dear Microsoft, I don't think you realize quite how badly you broke Skype for iOS.    In the past you could call people either via skype or on their phone based on a phone number that YOU added for them in Skype.  This no longer works.  You can now only call a person on the phone if they themself put that phone number into their skype account info.  So for example, I can no longer call my Dad (who is not great on computers and lives in another country) on the phone unless I spend about an hour with him teaching him how to add a phone number into Skype.    This is a very bad design change.  Please alert those working on the tool.

I did this by logging in from the same computer, using the same internet connection.    So I went back and logged in to my other family members account and bought a second number to see if that worked.  But still the same issue.  It just hangs up after 1 ring.  Could it be something to do with my nephews account.   He has the latest issue of Skype. He only has skype app on his phone.  Does he always need the skype logged in for it to work?  He is under 18?  Are there any restrictions perhaps on him having a skype number because of his age?   Can't really think of anything else.    Any help appreciated  Thanks, Chris  ",3,0.6122105151809939,0.8469615009073078,True,True,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3,0.75,524,65,61,True,True,False,False,0.0,0.886,0.114,0.9497

"  Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft community.   Based on your issue description, I understand that you are having difficulties to download apps from the Windows store.   I can understand how frustrating it could be when things don't work as expected.   To understand this issue better, I would like to know the following information:   1. Which app are you trying to download from Windows store? 2. Do you get any error message when the download fails, if so what is the exact error message? 3. Do you have any issues to launch Windows store?   Let's try the following the methods and check if it helps. Method 1: Run Apps troubleshooter.   This tool can automatically identify and fix some problems with apps and the Store. It's only available in English, but will work on PCs running any language.   Apps troubleshooter http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=268423 Method 2: If the issue still persists  clear Store Cache: a. Press Windows key + R. b. Type in “WSReset.exe”. c. Press ENTER. d. Restart the computer and check. Method 3: Check if the region is correct. Follow the steps mentioned: a. Type ""Region"" on the Start screen. Click ""Settings"" and press ENTER. b. On the ""Format"" tab, select ""English (United Kingdom)"". c. Click ""Languages Preferences"" > ""Add a language"" and add ""your language"". d. Once added, select it and click ""Move Up"" to make it the first language. Close the Language window. e. On the ""Region"" window, click ""Additional Settings"" and check if the values are same. f. Click the ""Location"" tab and change the Home Location to ""your country"" and then click OK. Method 4: If you are still having issues downloading from Windows store, place the computer in clean boot and check if you are able to access Window store. A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7, or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. How to perform a clean boot in Windows http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us Note: After troubleshooting, refer to this section “How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting. Additional reference: Troubleshoot problems with an app http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app   Why can't I find or install an app from the Windows Store? http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/why-find-install-app-windows-store   Hope this information helps, please reply with the status of the issue and the required information for further assistance.

"It is doing that because every IF field is in its own paragraph, and Word still displays/prints the paragraph mark.  If you want all the Doubleyes/ Doubleno values on one line, you can put all the IF fields on a single line, e.g.   { IF{ MERGEFIELD iscorrect } = ""0"" { MERGEFIELD Doubleyes1 } }{ IF{ MERGEFIELD iscorrect } = ""0"" { MERGEFIELD Doubleyes2 } }{ IF{ MERGEFIELD iscorrect } = ""0"" { MERGEFIELD Doubleyes3 } }etc.{ IF{ MERGEFIELD iscorrect } = ""1"" { MERGEFIELD Doubleno1 } }{ IF{ MERGEFIELD iscorrect } = ""1"" { MERGEFIELD Doubleno2 } }{ IF{ MERGEFIELD iscorrect } = ""1"" { MERGEFIELD Doubleno3 } }etc.  (If you need the values to be separate, put spaces or whatever between the IF fields).

This seems like a rather arbitrary limitation as you can set the left and right indentation for a normal paragraph. If I could use tabulations for my layout needs I could actually achieve what Bonnie is trying to do. In a normal style definition go to paragraph -> indentation -> left/right and enter the distance to the margin you want. Then define your tab stops as your columns.  You might actually be able to put lines over and under the individual lines in order to achieve a table look.

show on the task bar and still show the tab when I hover my mouse over it but when I clicked it it did nothing.   Check to see if you have a window that is moved off screen (or located on another monitor).  Right-click the Taskbar icon's thumbnail when you have raised it and choose Move from the thumbnail's window menu.  Notice the change in mouse pointer but in your case you can not use it to drag.  What you can do however is use a cursor key to engage the mouse pointer on the window's title bar for a drag move.  Then drag move the window into view.  In the case where the window is on a different monitor you would also have the (simpler) alternative of using a  Win+Shift+Cursor  move.

"Hi, I created an excel addin using office 2007. This XLA uses the MSSOAP30.dll to connect to/consume a web service. This dll is installed with MS Office. I copied this XLA to another computer which only runs office 2010. When I start excel 2010, I get an error message ""compile error in hidden module"". When I look at the VBA references, I can see that the reference is missing ""Missing: microsoft office soap type lib"". If I remove the XLA & start a brand new VBA project, the DLL is still not listed as an available reference. I know I can register the dll myself but the excel addin is meant for external clients.

"Hello, I recently installed the Office 365 Premium bundle on one of the laptops in our business, and Excel is acting rather weird. It won't open .xlsx files, unless I open them directly from Excel itself.  In other words, when I open an Excel file from My Documents or wherever, Excel (the program) opens, but shows a gray screen - it doesn't open the actual file. The only way I've found to open the files is to open them from within Excel (File > ...). I attach a few screenshots to illustrate the problem. 1- Opening the Excel file. 2- Excel opens, but not the file. 3- I try opening the same file from within Excel 4- And it opens.

"Earlier today I tried to do a bing search from my IE. From what I see the page has changed from what I normally see and am used to using. I was searching for a online game I had just beat called Tentacle Wars: PM to see if any other version were made or created, while I found a previously created game the images page that opened was different. So then clicked on videos and found the same style of change. Normally when I opened a web search for images or videos I would see a page of pictures and if you picked one it would ""open"" and popup in which you could see a ""toolbar"" of the previous and next pictures as well as enlarge the current picture and run the pictures thru slideshow. The video page would have a list of videos from different websites and also preview of the video if you placed the cursor over the image and if you clicked a video it would open in the popup screen and could play, pause,  go full screen. Now when I did the search today it only allows redirects to the page that the picture or video is hosted on, as well as the search list that appears only shows a few images or videos before you must go to the next page. Not sure if this is something that I can switch back to or something that Bing has done and will be the current version. I used to use the destop version of AOL on my old computer, and now that AOL is a webpage based site I have used Bing since.

"I think we need to clarify your question. If your cell is in Sheet1!B14... To tell other cells to display (and allow you to use the value of) that cell, put in those cells =Sheet1!B14. If you want to take the value that is in the cell and put it in those other cells, you can copy, then do a ""paste-special"" and choose ""values.""  This will copy the value of the cell you are copying from rather than the formula.  To paste-special either click the downward arrow just below paste in the macro bar or right click the cell you want to paste into and below ""paste options"" will be ""paste special."" If you copy a cell with a formula, excel will automatically copy it's relations to other cells in a ""relative,"" manner, so if your formula in the cell is =A12+B6 and you copy your formula to a cell two cells lower it will become =A14+B8.  so fix this use fixed references, which are indicated with a $ symbol.  So if you want to copy =A12+b6 to another cell in the same page, you can change it to =$A$12+$B$6.  Note that both the column and row get a $.  This is handy because it allows you to ""lock"" one part of the formula and not the other.  You can also press F4 to cycle through the lock options. If you create your formula in a single sheet, the formula won't bother to remember what sheet it is in, so if you copy that formula to another sheet it will use the same reference on the new sheet.  But if you add your sheet name to your formula then copying that formula will always reference that sheet.  So =A12+B6 will give you A12+B6 of whatever sheet you copy the formula to, but =sheet1$A$12+sheet1$B$6 will always refer to A12+B6 of sheet 1.  Hope this helps!

"Hi, Welcome to Microsoft answers. I suggest you to follow the below steps: 1. Insert the DVD in the CDDVD drive. 2. Open computer, click on DVD drive, and Select the files you want to copy. To select all files, press Ctrl and A keys together, to select files randomly press Ctrl and left mouse click on the file. 3. Right click on the selected files, click on copy. 4. Select the location where you want to save those files, right click and paste it.  If you are copying the music from an audio CD, then you need to rip the music.  Here are the steps: 1.      For best results, make sure that you are connected to the Internet before you begin. When your computer is connected to the Internet, the Player attempts to retrieve media information about the tracks being ripped from an online database. The Player then adds the information to the files during ripping. Note that you can rip a CD when your computer isn't connected to the Internet. However, the Player won't be able to identify the name of the CD, the artist who created it, or the names of the songs until you go online. 2.      Insert an audio CD into the CD drive. 3.      (Optional) If you want to select a different format (for example, MP3 instead of WMA) or bit rate (for example, 192 Kbps instead of 128 Kbps) for the files created during ripping, in the Player Library, click the Rip settings menu, and then click Format or Audio Quality. 4.      (Optional) If you don't want to rip every song, in the Player Library, clear the check boxes next to the songs you don't want to rip. 5.      Click the Rip CD button in Now Playing mode or Rip CD in the Player Library to begin ripping. After the songs have been ripped, you can find and play them in the Player Library.

"I went to do my Morning rutine of doing Bing Points,Checking my mail then doing some surveys.well This Morning after reading how Update KB3206632 had screwed up so many Folks by not allowing them to log onto the Web.Which in turn disabled any way of fixing this unless they were smart enough to figure out it was the update that caused the issue to begin with!I didn't receive the update until the 14th but it failed to install.It did auto install successfully on the 16th!??? WThey? 3 days later??? I was not affected by this but my BING search was.My Monthly counter is stuck at what it was before this update,My Rewards page gives me Two 10 point searches Today,so I proceede to get some points.I searched At the Movies first,yeah 10 points.I go to can you solve the Rubics Cube page and solve it.Should have earned 10 just for going there,which did not happen.But I didn't notice.I was going along on BING when I noticed the counter wasn't going up!!! I went back to my rewards page and refreshed the page and VIOLA my 10 points vanished!The counter  went back to where it was the Day before! :/ Any search makes me Zero points,except for just now I got 10 points for doing a manual search from bing.com.Well that 10 is all I got and again when I went to my Rewards page and refresh it,my points dropped back again!!! So I'm going to uninstall this SCREWED UP AND UNTESTED update and see if this solves my problem.If so,I'm deferring updates until MS can get their C R A P in one sox!As I have read they're in no hurry to fix this issue once again,just goes to show MS doesn't care about us as a user just a Customer! And yes I have also just cleared all browsers cache;I had to restart my PC to get EDGE to clean the browser cache as it refused to clean  everything 5 times!.Cleaned my PC,deleted files from Disk Cleanup,defragged and optimized after the update.It's the first thing I do on Sundays any way!

"Hi, I have just noticed that my phone automatically updated my mobil Skype app. I have everything about it and wish I can revert. The new version is completely useless to me in its current form. the problem I have with it is that people who i have been connected with for 15 years can't reach me on my mobil iPhone. Their calls are now only being received by Mac Book Pro lap top. Although the previous updates at least kept the app operational, although worse with each update, nothings don't work at all. Everything has been wiped out without my consent, besides my ID, login and password; even my profile picture. But the worse is that i can find access to my contact list I had there for the last 15 years, they are not the same contacts that are in my US phone book, they are all overseas and their information was only available on Skype. In all previous versions it remained intact and intuitive. how horrible is the app design if you have to do a research on how to access your own data on the account. if it is even there. Synching my phone contacts doesn't do any good in my situation, My notebook still has the old version, which may help in some data recovery, But how am i supposed to reenter it into a new app? how am i supposed to connect to people who were always in my Skype connected with me, but were never entered in my phone because there was never a need for it. phone list was for - phone call people , and Skype was to call people overseas who don't have access to international phone lines, or wi-fi strictly mobil apps like WhatsApp And Viber. or older generation who can handle a desktop version but doesn't have access to mobil.. the whole point of having Skype Mobil was to not have to lag a laptop around and have Skype in my phone to talk to my parents and grandparents overseas being available to them 24/7 with the new upgrade i don't even see how this can still work and continue to be useful. if there is no remedy and reinstalling my old contact list, there is no point for me to keep or use this mobil app version of Skype.

" Thanks, Carolyn Here's what I did: 1. Sign up for Microsoft Health Vault. 2. Go to the HealthVault tab/page of the Bing Health & Fitness App Settings, and connect to HealthVault there. 3. All data from the old phone will be stored on the cloud. 4. Refresh the HealthVault web site on your desktop or restart your phone to see all your exercises sync'd in the GPS tracker and online.   Additional info if helpful: The Bing Health & Fitness App data is not saved locally on the phone, so most of the suggestions in SmittyChat's response above didn't work (sorry).  Here's where the confusion stems: when you open the Health & Fitness App, if you go to the bottom-right and expand the menu options, the app gives you the option to connect to ""Microsoft Account."" It's not clear to me where the data goes when you do that, but I never found it again. But, if from that same expanded menu you select ""Settings,"" instead of ""Microsoft Account,"" there's a HealthVault tab/page that lets you connect to HealthVault so that when you sign in to Health Vault (on the phone or desktop) you can access your exercise history under Measurements > History. For any product team folks reading this, I recommend making this more intuitive.

"Just began using Office 2016.  As usual, Microsoft has changed what was working fine.  In this case, the spell checker in Word will not allow you to edit a misspelled word.  So if the spell check tool dopes not propose a correct spelling, apparently all one can do is to choose either the wrong word, or ""Skip.""  And in either case, you then have to remember what word it is and where it is, go find it, and manually correct it.  The spell checker was working just fine in earlier versions of Office (I migrated form office 10), in which you could edit the text (spelling as well as punctuation) in the spell checker.   So Microsoft, congratulations, you have once again broken what was working just fine!  You have degraded the capability of a tool that worked well for several versions -- back 10 or 15 years.

"Hi, please forgive me if some of my questions seem silly. I really am not technically minded and computers confuse me! Due to problems I have encountered with the Windows Update, I have decided to back up my Toshiba Satellite C55 for the first time and I am unsure on how to. When searching online, it seems that doing a System Image Backup is not recommended, so what is? I want to create a back up just in case something bad happens so I will be able to reinstall everything. I have read on this forum, and have printed off for reference, 'how to make a full back up of your Windows 10 PC' which explains how to perform a System Image Backup and it is recommended on there that you connect an external storage drive. However, I do not have and cannot afford the £50 plus for an external drive :( I attempted to do a back up today using File History onto a USB stick. But even that is not straightforward :/ The photo below shows what files are set to back up and what folders are excluded I do not know why the folders are in the back up these folders or exclude these folders. There are some folders in the exclude section that I can only find in the Recycle Bin and they are not currently in my Users folders. Please can someone let me know which folders should or should not be backed up? Thank you Below is a screenshot that I took today of the Users folders. The following 8 folders are there, not the 10 folders shown above. Does this matter?  Worryingly, below is a screenshot that I took about a year ago, which shows some completely different folders to what are showing in the above screenshot in Users today. Are any of the folders showing above, in the old screenshot, which are not now in my Users folder, important? I have no idea what .android, .dvdcss, .fontconfig, 3D objects, Gihosoft Android Recovery are. Can these be deleted/uninstalled or would it be detrimental to the performance of my laptop? I would be devastated if I lost any of my personal files (it happened before and I vowed it would never happen again) but here I am, only NOW attempting to do back ups of my personal files and of my laptop!

"Hi,  I recently started college and they were advising us to download the Office Student pack that was being offered free.  Which I did - from the official site and not the college one (just in case it'd been hacked).  Ever since whenever I try to open any browser apart from Microsoft Edge, I get the windows installer popup flashing up as though it's on a permanent loop.  It took me several attempts to download the software as I had forgotten that I'd installed the old Microsoft Word - which I think was the 2007 version -  from the disk I got with my old computer (back when you were given MS works, etc as a freebie with your computer).  I didn't have the disk but downloaded a tool from the MS site that would remove the software and allow a clean install of the new software.  The end result of this is as I said above - it's looping the installer pop up and it's so bad I can't use the browsers (or the Rootsmagic 7 software I also had on my pc and had used to work on my family tree - only the defunct Family Tree Maker software is viewable but I can no longer access my tree online through it so it's rather a waste of time using it).  I'm at the stage I'm ready the pc out of the window as I'm so frustrated.  Computers never used to be so difficult, when did it all change?

"Follow up from Matthew A15:  Thank you for the reply Smity. My first question after I wrote my post was would anyone reading it understand the issue or what I was describing. After I read your reply I began to think of a better way to describe it.  I searched ""Bing Image search"" and found a picture of the ""popup screen"" I was mentioning, it can be viewed at:  http://cdn2.ubergizmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/bing-image-search.jpg . Now as I described the search page is in the background of the screen and the ""popup window that has the options like enlarge, play slideshow.  When I searched ""Bing Video search"" I found a picture of the search result page for video, view here:  http://www.liveside.net/wp-content/images/2013/09/Bing-Video-Search.jpg. Now with each of these videos you see small icons on each video that would allow you to view the preview of the video (short few seconds) or if the video had to be viewed on the hosts page. Also a picture of the popup from a video viewed here: http://www.sitepronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Bing-video-search-4.jpg . Now in this you could watch the video while still on bing without a redirect (unless the video was marked that it was a redirect).  This is what I am looking for that browser/settings. Currently if I wish to search image or video I get a new window redirects to another site as well as only being able to view 28 (4x7) images before needing to go to the next page (the old version would just keep added them to bottom of page as well as having suggestions for other searches that could match).

"Okay, please understand, I am not trying to give anyone a hard time.  However I have a lot of experience with software and PC's and I sincerely believe that most people & companies have forgotten the main primary reason for the development of personal computers to begin with and that was for the purpose of improving efficiency in doing day to day things.  IF this does not apply to you, then PLEASE direct it to someone who does have responsibility for this area and let's get this addressed and corrected to improve efficiency.  Is that acceptable.  The situation is that in the beginning, we, the clients came to Bing and searched out images.  Among those images, we the clients wanted to save some of the images on our systems for many reasons, some legit, some not, but for now, lets through out the non-legitimate reasons for capturing/saving images from the net onto our computers. And so, once we entered the filters for the images and the search results were returned, we would scan all of the results and those we liked/wanted to keep, we simply could right click on the image, then click on ""save as"" and automatically, something would appear in the ""file name"" area which always began with ""th"" and then a series of numbers of alpha characters.  Now, yesterday, or last nght to be exact, I read your answer on how to get an auto name which is more involved as it requires more steps.  So, I came here today to see what can be done to get us back to where we were originally thus eliminating steps and making it easy, thus more efficient.  However, as I prepared this reply, to insure I was using the correct terms where needed, it has all changed again!  Here is what happened.   I went to BING.com.  In the search box, I entered ""waterfalls"" and hit the search button and then immediately received a page full of images of different waterfalls.  I went to one of them, and right clicked on it and the dialog box came up to save the image and there was a name in the ""file name"" box.  But, I tried it again, on a different picture and the same name was there.  I tried to follow the directions from yesterday which was to put the cursor on the picture and left click it.  Nothing. Nothing at all, period.  Apparently someone might be reading these exchanges and is doing something to make changes but now once again, I am lost.  Who at BING do we need to contact to request we get back to the original point whereby when images are shown in search results and we wish to save images all we have to do is right click on the image, the click on ""save as"" and something will automatically appear uniquely for each image in the file name box so all we then have to do is click on the ""save"" button and it is done?  How do we request this change for the purpose of efficiency and to whom do we make the request?  Lastly and again, please, I am not attempting to be a smart buy why when something like this is entered into the community isn't someone from BING reading these issues and deciding, ""Oh that belongs to the development group"" and then forwards it to that group so the actually experts are answering the issue while also addressing what can or cannot be done to make changes for the purposes of efficiency.  I sincerely do not mean to be harsh, hard, or a smart mouth person being mean.  I am a retired QC Engineer and thus spent a good portion of my life addressing problems from the standpoint of the cause and especially how to correct so it never happens again and in a very efficient manner.  If a person is making $50/hour working on fixing problems, you want the problem fixed as fast as possible but in a very efficient manner and in a manner that insures it does not have to be addressed again or you are not being efficient, correct?  So, lastly, who do we address regarding this problem to get it fixed (it should never have been changed from the way it was) so we the customers can save pictures/images from Bing without having to make 10 steps when it can be done in 2 or 3 steps?

It's like their Skype business card which contains all the details they've added – like a photo, city, country or phone number.   If profile information can’t help you find your friend, ask them for their Skype Name or the email address they registered with.   You may use this FAQ article below on how to find and add contacts on the new Skype app for Android.   https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34751/   Also, when you add someone on Skype, the person is added to your contact list, but will appear offline until they accept your request.

"I'm not an AI user but in the past I've seen the problem with curves and such getting pixelated (actually, they're being rendered as a series of short lines, not getting pixelated, but the effect is similar).  The fix there seems to be to make the shapes as big as possible in AI before exporting to EMF.  Or at least this is how it used to work; apparently AI breaks curves into XX segments per point or inch or whatever.  The bigger you make the graphic, the more segments you get, so the smoother the line.   As far as gradients, my experience has been that you're better off leaving things flat-colored in AI then ungrouping and applying gradients in PPT.  Otherwise, the gradient is liable to turn into a skillion individual shapes, making editing a nightmare.  As to the white borders, not sure, but quite often (I'd say ""always, in my experience"") EMFs include a background object.  Ungroup the EMF after inserting it into PPT, select the b/g object, delete it, then regroup the remaining shapes.  I can't really say what might help to make the PDF editable; it'd depend on what tools are used and what type of editing is needed.  The above suggestions will probably help, at least somewhat.

Anyone know if/when it will update or how I can get the newest version on my Surface? ***Post moved by the moderator to the appropriate forum category.***,1,1.0000000000000002,0.866824772799063,True,False,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1,0.3333333333333333,327,40,38,True,False,False,False,0.019,0.981,0.0,-0.1603

"Here's one curious thing that I discovered. I've been trying all the things listed to get my store to show up. The obvious search terms are ""Toronto Motorcycle Shop"" No luck. There's a hamburger joint with motorcycle in its name, some insurance brokers that offer motorcycle insurance, several out of town shops and some that are closed, but I'm nowhere. I change the search to just ""motorcycle shop"" which lets Bing decide the location and I show up right at the top. Now I happen to be in Toronto, so I don't know why using that word would cause my listing to be excluded. My address is consistently shown as being in Toronto.  You might be interested that Google has its own peculiarity. Including Toronto or not makes no difference, but I don't show up for searches for ""motorcycle shops"" at all. I show up fairly high if I search for ""motorcycle stores"" and when I show up my Google listing describes my store as a ""motorcycle shop"".   Of course the trouble is that I think most people will search for ""Toronto motorcycle shop"" and not some odd variant. I think that the local search function from both companies is seriously screwed up. The only thing I've found that works is paying for advertising.

"Hi,  Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.  This issue could be caused due to some incorrect settings or due to a connection issue. I would suggest you to try the following steps and check:   Method 1: Apps troubleshooter   The apps troubleshooter can automatically detect and fix any incorrect settings or errors that could cause issues with apps. You can visit this link to download and run this troubleshooter:   http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=268423   Method 2:   If the troubleshooter didn’t detect any incorrect settings, I would suggest you check and install any updates available for these apps and check. Refer to these steps: a)      Press Windows key + C from the store app. b)      Click on settings and then “App updates”. c)       Click on “Check for updates” to check and install any updates available for apps.   Method 3:   If no updates were available or if installing updates didn’t resolve the issue, then it could be due to some connection issue. If you have installed any third party security software like antivirus program/firewall, they can interfere with the download. I would suggest you to temporarily disable and check if you are able to download the update.   Important Note: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.   Method 4:   If you have setup a proxy connection, I would suggest you to disable the proxy and check. Refer these steps:     Method 5:   If the above steps didn’t help, then I would suggest you to uninstall and reinstall the app and check. When you uninstall the calendar app, the mail and people app will also be removed as these apps are installed as a group. Refer to the section, “reinstall the app” in this link:   http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app   Try these steps and let us know the results.

" You can do this if you have a range that is NOT an Excel table. If you are using a table, you need to convert it to a range first.

In this example, row 43 is the first visible data row in the filtered range, so the formula refers to rows 1 to 42.  Hold down the Ctrl key and hit Enter. The formula will now be applied to all the visible cells.  Now you can remove the filter to see that the consecutive numbering has only been applied to the rows that you had previously showing.

Hi Melissa  Thank you for the quick reply.  Office 365. Currently version 1707 is on my other computers so I can only guess that is what was on the computer with the problem.  The problem is not file specific.    If I click on an Excel file in Windows Explorer it takes 30 seconds to start/open. If I have Excel open but use Windows Explorer to find the file I is very quick. If I open a file within Excel it is very quick. The problem lies within the ability to start Excel from Windows Explorer and has nothing to do with the files.  My complaint was that the repair function completely deleted all my Office apps!!!. I had to reinstall Office 365 from scratch. I am now on version 1708 and Excel and files open quickly.  The advice to repair is wrong until the repair function is fixed. Advice to delete and reinstall Office is correct but a nuisance.   I assume all the computers will automatically upgrade to version 1708     ,3,0.5821741602302496,0.8446430561136308,False,False,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3,0.375,648,56,53,True,True,True,False,0.093,0.797,0.11,0.5074

Works as expected for me, using Excel 2010 and 2003.  When I copy a sheet with a chart, then edit the data on the new sheet, the new sheet's chart reflects the new sheet's data, and the old sheet's chart continues to reflect the old sheet's unchanged data.

"I developed a deck in PowerPoint (Office 365) in which an audio file starts up automatically on each of its slides when it plays in Slide Show. Each slide has its own audio file embedded within to accomplish this. There is also one long audio file that plays across 19 slides lasting a minute and a half, early in the deck. The deck also employs timing to delay animation and time transitions from slide to slide. Everything works like a charm on my machine. If you'd like, you can download the deck yourself (in a ZIP file), open it on your local machine, and play it in Slide Show to see what I mean (it's about baseball, not business, so it's a fun deck): https://1drv.ms/u/s!AlhyBM_m6GEbi0EYUDlpfmkXZRW6  I uploaded the deck to my OneDrive and I would like for it to play the same way when I or someone else starts the slide show in PowerPoint Online. All the timing I added to the deck works great Online, exactly as intended. What doesn't work is the audio autostarting on each page.

"Hi Curtis,   Thank you for persisting and trying to reproduce my ""bug."" I know it was there because I could reproduce it at will. I thought, ""Maybe I should make them a movie to demonstrate it..."" but decided against it because it was so obscure. Someone would have to use the Outline icon on the QAT, then click it while in slide master view. I just deleted the icon and walked away after posting. I had spent enough time on the problem.  But today, since you posted and were trying, I thought I would make a movie for you.  But I could not reproduce the problem by adding Outline back to the QAT. Now my behavior is the same as yours--everything works as expected.  The only mysterious thing is that the Outline icon now looks like the Normal View icon, instead of the look it had before (unless my memory is lying to me).   Anyhow, removing and adding the Outline icon to the QAT has solved my problem, so I'm happy.

I'll first say, I appreciate the work of Lisa Pillai for providing a solution that fills a gap of PowerPoint and a thank you to him for providing a free tool. It's been helpful to me with legacy versions of PowerPoint and works great. To be specific, the posts/threads/sites I have read through are: ""LiveWeb in PowerPoint"" - https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_powerpoint-mso_winother/liveweb-in-powerpoint-2016/5c883360-cecc-4a67-8f11-b22be06a4db8 vanderBlog: Realtime Webpages - https://vdpluijm.blogspot.com/2014/01/real-time-webpages-in-powerpoint-2013.html LiveWeb FAQ's from Mr. Pillai - http://skp.mvps.org/livewebfaq.htm I have the add-in 'working' without errors for ActiveX or Macros by changing the respective registry entries for my Office 2016 .msi installation on one box and the ClickToRun installation on a 2nd box.  I have attempted a few different browser emulation modes after beginning with the defaults from the LiveWeb FAQ page. Here's the issue I am having: When I visit the slide with the LiveWeb control the very FIRST time the slide ONLY displays a blank page.  If I arrow back one page or use a hyperlink back to another page and then return to the LiveWeb slide I see the embedded webpage as desired.  Once I close the presentation and open it again I have to visit the page once (getting the blank page) then go to another slide and then come back in order  for the page to be displayed and continues to display until I close the presentation and open it again. Testing I have tested on two different machines and multiple profiles to attempt to eliminate any local issues.  I have used both the LiveWeb.exe install process and the ppam add-in steps during my testing. My configuration is: Win10 1703 (Creators Update) Office 2016 .msi  (although I have the same outcome on ClickToRun Machine) patched to July and then August 2017 with Office updates Default MS Edge Browser (I have also set IE as the default during testing) I have tested PowerPoint in Kiosk Mode (the one I'd like to use with the add-in) as well as standard ""presented by speaker"" mode. Both give same results. A thought or two: To add to what I am seeing, I can tell the add-in is running because when I run the presentation and hit the slide with LiveWeb control in it and it doesn't display I can ""Alt-Tab"" and see a process window running with the content.  I cannot open that window from there but it is there.  So, I know it is not being 'blocked' and I don't receive any errors.

"Hi James,   I’m glad to hear that your issue has already been resolved. Just a reminder, to have a good call quality in using Skype for Mac, make sure that you and the person you are calling are using the latest version.  If you’re audio call is delayed or with poor quality please check your connection. It might be your internet connection (or your friend's) causing the problem.If Skype detects a weak connection, it will reduce the quality to try and stop the call from dropping altogether.   Close any applications that could be interfering with your call. File sharing applications, streaming audio or video, or even just having a web browser open are all things that can eat up bandwidth.   If the issue still persist you can try to uninstall, then reinstall the Skype application. Make test call after a successful reinstall.   Thank you!

"Hello,  I think Windows Defender does a decent job in protecting you computer from the most prevalent and widespread threats. Combined with Windows Firewall, you also get a protection from online unauthorized access to you computer and LAN protection from local networks attacks (like in open wifi zones). However, Windows Defender scores low in many AV tests given that these tests really use very sophisticated malware that are zero-day malware (Windows Defender scores very low in this category). Normal users do not typically encounter those creepy malware. Also, Windows Defender does not provide strong protection against ongoing exploits (some other security products can detect exploit activity on vulnerable apps and prevent it), so make sure you keep all you software updated, especially Windows, as Microsoft continuously provide new updates to secure you system.  Now, you are the one to decide if you need an additional security software or not. I just can give you some points to consider while deciding.  1- Are you a cautious user? This mean, for example, do you easily recognize suspicious websites or downloads or not. Or can you spot signs of infection? 2- How often do you shop online using your banking information? 3- Do you have very important data in your computer (this may sound silly :) )? 4- Do you install infamous software often? 5- Do you mind running MalwareBytes scans weekly? 6- etc...  Just understand that if you want premium protection, Windows Defender is far from being the best product, however, it provides decent protection against the most common threats. Advanced security products often offer advanced cloud protection, very impressive detection of zero-day malware (very recent unknown threats), automatic prevention from exploits, protection from fishing websites (higher than the smart screen filter)...  You choose, I think you are the only one to know if you need high protection or only a basic one. I used Windows Defender in Windows 8/ Windows 8.1 for quite some time and it did a great job protecting my system until once I realized I had a rootkit that it did not detect. I am now using another security suit.  I hope this helps.",5,0.3134784334256449,0.9170624734549377,True,False,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,5,0.8333333333333334,1616,158,146,False,False,False,True,0.075,0.764,0.16,0.9823

"I am just distraught over the fact that Bing Maps has changed. They were so much better than Google Maps, especially after Google changed their maps to the 'enhanced' view. None of the images were or are clear. Well now Bing Maps has taken the same road. Instead of leaving a good thing alone, they had to go and change the imagery to the 'enhanced' look and now everything is all distorted. I love looking at different types and styles of homes and now everyone I want to look closer at gets distorted. This was my way of traveling the world as I am housebound.  WHY DID THEY HAVE TO DO THIS? If they wanted to change the Maps, at least give us a link to the old mapping system so we can enjoy the REAL IMAGES instead of the computer generated maps. PLEASE, please Bing, let us use the older mapping system again with a link to the older maps. The new one is going to make Bing followers flee and drop Bing altogether. Does anyone out their know of a mapping system with Birds Eye view that shows the 'raw' images like Bing Maps used to until today? They obviously don't care about their long term clients (I have been here since the beginning of Bing and the internet) I am looking to log out of Microsoft and Bing forever.... Here are a few examples, though these are the GOOD ones.. Please click on them to really SEE the difference.  PLEASE BRING OUR OLD MAPS BACK! (Or a link to the older version) Thank you.

"Any software that produces EMF will likely have the same kinds of problems.  EMF/WMF graphics are fairly primitive and don't include the ability to handle things like gradient fills, soft edges/shadows and the like.  Instead, programs that export EMF have to perform workarounds; to ""preserve"" a gradient, they'll export gazillions of rectangles or polygons that, together, look like a single gradient filled shape.  Editing these?  A nightmare!  I would suggest this workflow:  Draw your graphics in any program that works well for you, but stick with simple shapes and lines.  Don't do any gradient fills or other fancy effects.  Export as EMF, import the EMF into PowerPoint, ungroup it and THEN apply any effects you like to the shapes.  Once you do this, the graphic will be in native MS Office format; you can copy/paste it from PPT to Word and it should retain all of its characteristics.  You might, in fact, be able to import the EMF directly into Word, ungroup and apply effects there.  Since PPT is the tool I use most often, I'd rather work there and then copy to Word, but if going directly to Word works well for you, leave PPT out of the equation entirely.

"If your Word 2011 .dot file involved floating toolbars, you should know that those were axed from Word 2016, so you're basically out of luck. Yes, it's a known issue, but they did it on purpose and have no intention of making user-created .dot files compatible from 2011 forward to 2016 beyond the limited functionality you've already discovered, where some buttons continue to work but others are either grayed out/unclickable or don't work as expected, even ones that have worked perfectly for years in 2011.  I've discovered that hard way that you basically need to be a professional programmer if you ever expect to figure out why, or how to fix them. And in your case, it sounds like you didn't even create the original .dot template--your client/company did--so you're probably locked out of editing anyway, even if you did have the coding knowledge.  You should either ask the company who supplied the .dot file if they have an updated version of their template that works with Word 2016 for Mac, or you'll need to go back to using Word 2011.  If your work requires the use of a template that only works in Word 2011--or even if your workflows are just marginally sped up by being able to use those buttons--then Word 2016 probably isn't a viable solution for your needs.

"Hello Antonio,  Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.  As per your description, I understand that the two IWDAud Devices load over and over again and it impact the running applications including Mozilla Firefox. I will certainly help you with the issue.  1. Have you recently made any changes on your computer, prior to the issue? 2. Which forum suggested you that the issue is related with KB3022345? 3. Is there any Windows Update which has been failed recently? As of now, I recommend you to go through following methods:  Method 1:  Please put the computer in Clean Boot mode and check if you are getting the error message.  Boot the computer in a Clean Boot state and check the status. A clean boot helps to verify if any third party application service or startup item is causing this issue.  Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow steps under “How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot” in the article to boot to normal startup.  If issue persists, scan your computer using SFC Scan to fix the possible corruption of Windows system components.  Method 2:  I would suggest you to perform SFC scan and check if that helps. The sfc/scannow command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.    Note: System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.

"Charles, Thanks for the follow-up. I tried both methods. The food app seems to operate the same. I can touch a Category and move it. That highlights the Category and pulls up a menu on the bottom of my Surface Pro. But the Category won't move so I can't reorder alphabetically. Another feature I'm surprised the app won't allow - I can't more recipes from the My Recipes Category to any of the other Categories. So, if I'm looking for, say, a recipe using chicken, I have to look in both the Chicken and My Recipes Categories which works against the benefit of having Categories to organize and find recipes.

"Thank you for your reply.  I deleted the App data and started installation again, and chose 'deny' in the part which asked to access my contacts. As you suggested, this fixed the problem of having 100's of entries and duplicates in my Skype Contacts List.  However, I should stress to others reading this thread that the App doesn't use the word 'sync' during set-up. It is just the normal 'allow Skype to access your contacts' permission. Usually you would grant apps this permission during install, and then things like syncing and managing contacts would have options in the App itself.

In the same version of MS word on my Windows work computer I can increase the size of the whole document using the zoom slider at the bottom of the document and this in turn increases the spell check box text size. However doing this does not have the same result on my mac version. Any ideas?

"Hello this is Michael. The first screenshot you provided shows Cloud drives. I would remove those as that data is also in the cloud and on your computer. OneDrive and Dropbox files should be synced to the cloud so those do not need to be put on a USB normally. I would concentrate on backing up what is important to you. Documents, pictures, music, favorites. Some of those folders are not necessary to backup in that screenshot. Any folder that has a period in front (.android) is configuration information for devices like your mobile device that do not necessarily need to backed up. My advice is to keep it simple. Find what is the most important and include only those in your backup. I personally use OneDrive as my backup. It will depend on how much space is in your OneDrive or Dropbox and how much your backing up.

This proved to be caused by the configuration of the Privacy Badger (tracking cookies) extension - Bing Maps requires access to a third party website.  The extension is installed in Firefox on both PCs.  Bing Maps used to work on both PCs but recently only on one.  Presumably the setting that disabled Privacy Badger protection for *.live.com had become lost or corrupted on the problem PC.  (Quite how is another matter.)  Once the *.live.com exception had been re-added all was well again.  P.S. I asked on this forum rather the Mozilla one because I wished to find out what Bing Maps required in order to work correctly.  Now I have found that access to bing.com is not sufficient - access to live.com is required also.  This was not immediately apparent on using Bing Maps.

"So I have an excel document that has 100+ worksheets in it. We use this to list all of the various materials that we need to purchase for a project. For example, if we are using 5 different sizes of screws, we would list all of these out and then have a total quantity needed cell beside it.  Most of these sheets are identically set up in the same manner, with the exception that the name of the sheet is different and the various quantities will vary on each sheet. On our main page (Master BOM), we type out all of the different items and then we go onto the various worksheets (UNIT NAMES) that use those products. On these pages we type the quantity we need and we have it set up to where all of these sheet quantities are totaled on the Master BOM sheet. What I am now trying to do is create another sheet that lists the names of all of the worksheets and then beside these names list the total number of units being made. For example, if we are building 3 different sized boxes named Box A, Box B, and Box C, and we are ordering 2,4, & 6, respectively, I have a cell labeled Box A and the cell beside it has a quantity of 2 in it. Make sense? So I have my list completely done and the quantities listed beside them. What I am needing to do is have that corresponding quantity automatically link to the worksheet for that particular unit. So using my example above, I have Box A listed with 2 quantities. I want that 2 (or whatever number I have to update it to) to automatically link to the worksheet that I have for Box A (and yes the worksheet is labeled as Box A already). Is there a way to do this without me having to go through every single sheet and type that it is equal to a certain cell?

"Please, I need your help. I am formatting a manuscript for print (paperback) using Word 2016, running Windows 10.

"So, there have been some other threads about my travails with my email system. I'm in the process of finally, I thought, getting to a point I could live with it. To refresh, a new W7Pro installation, a new WLM12 installation, and an import project from a couple of different sources.  I successfully transferred the most important files, and redid subfolders such that I could find stuff, new and old, again. But today, things were getting worse than it has been in the few days prior, which is to say that WLM ""not responding"" happens more and more, and, today, after a restart (which seems to work for a while, usually), my ENTIRE tree was empty.  That is, all my accounts (there are 4 that I have, two of which are not checked any more) had nothing in any of the folders, and my outbox location had moved back to the bottom of all those, when I'd not long ago moved it to between my primary account and the 'quick views' - which ALSO had nothing showing other than what emails had just come in on the reload's automatic checking. Not panicking yet, I went to the storage folder.  Ha!  It's all there (or seems to be).  Except, for example, my drafts, which have stuff going back nearly 20 years, now has no date older than a month ago, with the vast bulk being 10 days ago's date. Well, that's a nuisance, but liveable.  So, I go about (again!!!) importing all that; I presume that I will then laboriously have to move all of those folders and sub folders from some storage file back up to where I can actually conveniently access them. But wait!  The drafts folder, all 901 entries, has now been emptied.  I have no idea, as it's still in the laborious process of moving all 36GB back into the folder or whatever it's called that will allow me to see them in my WLM when I open it (rather than seeing some encoding which has no relationship - and now, not even a date - with what I can look for), whether that's a display anomaly, or that importing them (which I presume will show those in some other folder name when I again examine the WLM store folder) actually takes them  out of the source folder, or if the problem somehow is with my W7Pro file manager. This is beyond distressing, as my very extensive and time-consuming reconstruction of my email information just went belly up. Would a restore to an earlier date cure that issue (that is, give me my email folders as I had it earlier this morning), without losing the work I've done in the meantime? I'm very nervous, as my email is basically my life's story, and all of my various charitable projects, and the rest of it, and this is just the icing on the cake of the various other issues which have shown up in these forums. So, to summarize: WLM has been locking up frequently.  A restart usually makes it work again for a while. There is, most of the time, some time spent 'restoring the database' or some such similar message before it actually opens again. The last time I did that, ALL of my current folders were empty.  All of the accounts I had, all of the laboriously reconstructed prior files in the storage folder, message rules and the like, all were gone. Inspection of the Message Store file (via windows explorer or whatever means lets me open a folder directly) showed that under a different name, all of the missing folders were present, albeit with mangled dates in some cases. Importing all of those is currently under way (at 36 or so GB, it will take a long time), but in at least one case, drafts, that folder (in the message store folder) is empty. That is, it's as though someone highlighted all and pushed the delete button.  The file exists, right where it was before, but now all 901 items are gone. I have no idea what's causing all this.  I have a new PS, MOBO, quad-core brain, 1T new 7200RPM drive, and NO other programs that I use give me any grief.  WLM seems to give me endless grief. So, would restoration (assuming some of my many restarts actually set a restore point) to earlier today put it all back together? and Without having to be an Outlook or some other web-based Microsoft client, is there some other email client which can replace WLM12?  I've been using essentially the same thing since OE, which is why I have drafts (where I keep stuff I want to refer to often) all the way back to 1995 (or, at least, I used to have them...).

"For starters, Skype has no phone technical support number.  Performing a more thorough search should inform you that the number you are dialing is a scam number out to steal your information and money.  They have no access to your Skype account or your computer unless you provide them with that information.  I have had a Skype number for over a decade.  If you just set up a Skype number it may take some time to activate initially (possibly 24 hours or so).  If you are online in Skype and people call that phone number from their mobile or landline number, your Skype client should ring.  A Skype number is an inbound-only subscription.  A Skype number by itself does include any ability to dial phone numbers for free.  That still requires credit or a subscription.   You may want to determine whether inbound call  issues are solely related to the client version on your phone or its sleep status.  Having a static client that is on 24x7 may prove to be more reliable for inbound calls as variables are reduced.  You may want to try a desktop or the web client just to see if calls are getting through on those Skype clients.  If you need to get a hold of Skype Customer Service, you can do so over live chat.  To do so, contact Skype Customer Service for assistance.  To reach that support you simply need to choose the correct topic, sub-topic and click on ""Next"" to get a live chat option.

"Hi Kristin,   Although you need to do what follows to deal with the infection (and you are most certainly infected), and while this is no guarantee and usually used for a more widespread hidden file problem, the following Unhide program may solve the immediate problem concerning hidden files you raise in your post: http://download.bleepingcomputer.com/grinler/unhide.exe.  But that's by no means the end of it and please don't stop there even if it works because that's just one of the more obvious tips of the iceberg and we need to deal with the infection itself to resolve this properly.   Another common trick to block internet access can sometimes be resolved as follows: Restore Internet Connection: Open IE, Tools, Internet Options, Connections, LAN Settings, uncheck “Use Proxy Server.”  As with the above, even if this works, we are still far from done.  We've just possibly resolved some of the obvious symtoms but must still remove the infection.   Whether or not those worked, try the following (in Safe Mode with Networking if that helps).  If you're stuck, skip to the bold part and just get expert help (which is what I honestly recommend as what you should do in any case as it is safer, faster, easier, and more certain to resolve the problem and have it verified by specialists in malware-removal so you can be more comfortable that the problem (and maybe others as well) has truly been resolved).  The problem here is that you are infected by a Rogue virus and while standard recovery techniques sometimes will help, you really need to deal with the infection and not just the consequences of the infection - though we may need to deal with them as well later if fixing the source of the problem doesn't do so (or the experts you get to help you don't also assist you with that as well).   First, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:http://www.malwarebytes.org/ and SuperAntiSpyware:http://superantispyware.com/ and then run a full ESET online scan: http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner. These may or may not remove the infections, but will probably not repair any damage caused by them. Even if they or your current AV software seem to work or indicate you aren't infected, you shouldn't completely trust them and need to continue with the recommendations that follow (so it's up to you if you want to try them first or just skip over all of this and get the expert help you really need as described below).   Properly and completely removing such infections can be complex and often require manual removal procedures (which may or may not be entirely effective either). Even if they work, I'd suggest the following anyway, so we may as well start there (you can ignore the above removal methods if you want as this is really the way to go, but it won't hurt to try them).   Please follow these recommendations compliments of Stephen Boots - MVP:   Are you running Microsoft Security Essentials?   If so: Start here - https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/ and select the link that says - I think my computer is infected - and then select the support option for phone, chat or email (options will vary by Region)   If not using MSE:   You can start here: https://consumersecuritysupport.microsoft.com/ or here:http://support.microsoft.com/contactus/cu_sc_virsec_master?ws=support#tab0 for help and support for malware infections.

"Hi,  This could be due to any corruption in system files or any third party software conflict. Try the steps below and check.  Step 1: Start the computer in safe mode and check the behavior  Safe mode is a troubleshooting option for Windows that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started. The words Safe Mode appear in the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you're using.  a. When you hit the power button, hold down the Shift key when clicking the Restart button. b. The next screen will present you with three options. Click Troubleshoot. c. Next, hit Advanced options followed by Windows Startup Settings from the next screen. d. Your PC will now be rebooted to enable the advanced parameters, which include Safe Mode as well.  Step 2:  If the issue does not persist in safe mode, place the computer in clean boot state to avoid any third party software conflict.  To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a ""clean boot."" A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.  Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.  How to perform a clean boot in Windows          Note: Refer ""How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.  Step 3: Run the System File Checker tool  System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.  Press Windows key + X and click Command Prompt (Admin) Type the following command and press Enter  sfc /scannow  Note: Do not close this Command Prompt window until the verification is 100% complete. The scan results will be shown after this process is finished.  Hope this information is helpful.

"Hi, I'm really thankful for your response and taking your valuable time.  I've tried your both the methods i.e. method 1 and method 2 but still it failed to give me result.  In method 1 I tried Troubleshooter but it is re-directed me towards Microsoft community  Method 2 also I tried but setting ""Automatic"" mode and click on stop and restart the bluetooth device And also the device manager.  Still its showing same.  Additional Info :-  1. I checked my bluetooth manufacturer, its Aethros ( spelling may not be correct)  2. I tried to connect my Android mobile, its first connected by entering 6 digit PIN but in few seconds, got dis-connected. 3. My bluetooth headset also initially got connected but same... within few seconds, got disconnected. 4. Same headset got immediately connected to Asus tablet ( transformer) and any android mobile. also in headset broucher they have given me default PIN ""0000"" 5. I tried "" add Device"" but can't diagnose, instead in ""Add device"" it shows some other phone models which even I can't recognize (... may be outside.... ) 6. I tried to update bluetooth driver also but it shows ...' driver is up todate and best driver is installed.   After reading many discussions on Acer or Microsoft community website... I guess, its about Bluetooth driver. So can you provide me the link where I can get updated Bluetooth driver suited to Acer Iconia W701 tab.

"When you say not referring to Autosave"" I am not sure if you mean the Auto Recover or AutoBackup. There is a description of AutoBackup at the following link. (Go down towards the end of the page under heading ""AutoBackup"")    https://www.online-tech-tips.com/ms-office-tips/excel-autorecover-and-automatic-backup/  However, the above method overwrites the previous backups and if this is not what you require and you want to keep several versions of backups then you will need to change the document to a Macro Enabled Workbook and use the Save Event VBA code below.   To install the VBA Event code:  Now when the workbook is saved, if changes have been made since opening,  then a backup file will be created in the same folder as the master. If no changes then the file will save as normal but no backup will be created. The backup File Name is in the format  Filename yyyy-mm-dd hh mm ss.xlsm The reverse date with year first is used so the file names can be sorted. All 2 digit months, days, hours, minutes and seconds are used because sorting is based on text and this ensures that sorting occurs correctly.  If the User selects ""Save As"" then the backup code is not implemented and allows the user to create a file name of choice. ie the user might select a backup version and the use Save As to replace the master copy.  Feel free to get back to me if any problems.   Copy all of the code below into the VBA editor.   Private Sub Workbook_BeforeSave(ByVal SaveAsUI As Boolean, Cancel As Boolean)         Dim strBackupName As String         'If user selects ""Save As"" then the code for backup does not run so that user     'can select a backup and then save to whatever name is required     If SaveAsUI = False Then         'Only run backup code if change made.

I have a Microsoft Surface RT running 8.1.  It is 3 years old and I love it.  The problem I have is that the daily updates (like Windows Defender) are using up all my spare disc space.  I do not have large apps on those computer.  I am down now to 4.12 gigs left and going down rapidly.  I really don't want a new machine and am wondering how to get my disc space back and how to stop updates using my disc space. ,1,1.0,0.7389474165883462,False,False,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1,0.14285714285714285,272,38,38,True,False,False,False,0.069,0.843,0.088,0.4019

"Hi,   Thank you so much for posting your query on this forum.   From the issue description, I understand that you have set your browser homepage as “Bing.com”, however, when you sign out from your Outlook.com email account, it redirects automatically to the MSN website and would like to know if you can change any settings so that it goes to the Bing website.   The Outlook.com website is designed in such a way that it redirects automatically to the MSN website whenever the user logs out from the Outlook.com email account. This behavior cannot be changed by changing any settings on the computer. This is by the website design.

"I have a new Dell Inspiron laptop 15 5000 which came with Office 365 and Skype free 60 minutes of calls per month. I had previously used Skype on my android phone with a friend on her Mac laptop. When I first set up the new laptop, Skype seemed to set itself up after I synced my contacts. My friend is moving out of the country in a few days, and we were practicing doing video calls on my new Dell. She called me first, and she was already a contact. I did not know how to answer the call because I had no notification buttons on my open Skype screen. I managed to disconnect the call, and she called me back. This time, there was a notification box at the lower right and had the answering options of audio or video. I picked video and we connected. She saw me on her end, and she also saw herself in the little box in the corner...so that must mean her camera was working. On my end, I saw myself in the little corner box, but I never saw her...just her avatar in the center of the screen. Our audio was fine, just not the video. I have a new Dell so I am sure I must have the latest version of Skype, but there is a problem. I have no menu, and the only place I have to click on the Skype page which first comes up from the desktop is Check Account or Invite a Friend. On the left side of the page, there is only an option to check my Contacts List.  When I click Check Account, I find an option for Settings, but there is no Tools or Options within the Settings list. There is a Privacy Settings, but it all it does is show my profile. The self help stuff I have found so far from Googling is from Skype support which says to go to Tools and then to Options and then to Automatically Receive Video and make sure that either Anyone or Contact List Only is checked...that if nothing is checked then I won't be able to see any video.  So, I would do that if I could, but I have no way to get to Tools in the first place. There is nothing to click, no options at all. I really need to figure this out quickly. Is my Skype software corrupted? Do I need to download it? If I did what would happen to my setup? It came on my Dell, so I never downloaded anything.

If the heading comes after the section break (that is, it's part of the multi-column section), then collapsing the heading will collapse the text below it -- again, down to the next heading of the same level or the next section break.",4,0.40408484945280104,0.793558859050881,False,True,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4,0.5714285714285714,357,29,28,False,False,False,False,0.095,0.885,0.019,-0.875

"First of all, the instructions from Christopher Chen will cause trouble sooner or later: A user document saved with the name Normal.dotm will not function properly as a basis for new documents. The Normal.dotm must be generated by the program.  It would have been better to Open the original Normal.dotm & change the Zoom level there. Unfortunately, this has been made difficult due to Apple's decision to make the Library folders for User Accounts Hidden by default [OS X 10.7 & later]. As a result it cannot be accessed from within the program unless you first UnHide that folder. Hopefully you have not deleted your former Normal.dotm template or did follow the suggestion to create a backup of it. If that's the case I'd suggest that you:   To retrieve your MacChristopherros as well as any User-Defined Styles, & AutoText Items: If you haven't deleted your former Normal.dotm template, use the Organizer to copy the customizations from one template or document to another. The Organizer can be reached from either of several directions:  The newly generated Normal.dotm will be displayed in one column. Close the Document1 in the other column & navigate to Open the former Normal.dotm containing your macros. See the Word article:  Make a macro available to all documents in Word 2016 for MacChristopher - Word ...  If you have deleted your former Normal.dotm based on the instructions from TinaChristopher Chen without creating a backup... well, all I can say is that her reply is evidence of the adage ""A little knowledge can be a dangerous thing.""

"Hi Dustin,  I can imagine the inconvenience you are experiencing and will certainly help you in the right direction to fix the issue. However, I would appreciate if you could answer a few questions to narrow down the issue in order to provide you with better assistance.   If you are using Internet Explorer try the steps provided below and see if it helps you to fix the issue.  Method 1 There could possibly be a problematic add-on which might be causing the problem. Let’s try the following to see if an add-on is causing this issue. We can do this by running Internet Explorer in No Add-ons mode.

To make a really long story short, I need to eliminate all single values in one particular column in my spreadsheet. By ""single value"" I am referring to single letters, such as ""A"", ""B"", ""C"" etc. These are the middle names of the spreadsheet, and I need to get rid of them for a specific column. Because there is so much data, it is unrealistic for me to do this manually. These single value letters are in the same column as  regular word values with full last names, so I can't just delete the entire columns without getting rid of the regular names that I want to keep.

Thank you. I wasn't aware that it made a difference which way you signed in. The issue regarding subscriptions is resolved I guess because I discontinued payments with paypal so I understand that that will automatically cancel my subscription. I am still however frustrated with Skype's communications on this issue and the way this new upgrade has been handled. Not being able to sign into Skype on my old computer and not being able to use the subscription that I had paid for for three months is really not very business friendly. Not impressed. It would also be easier to just send an email to Skype customer service if there are issues rather than having to use this forum. But at least I got a response here.

I have un-installed it, did a cold boot and re-installed it from Microsoft Store. Same thing. I can Start from a full power down shutdown and start Bing News first. Still crashes. Funny, the Live Tile  updates. I have a Surface Pro2 512 with the newer 4300 processor. I am on Windows 8.1 and I have no pending updates. I have not installed any new programs. I can access the Microsoft Store without problem and all other Metro apps run fine. Bing News seems to have started this behavior on its own.

"Chase,  Thanks for the 5 year old link. It was interesting to read what was available 5 years ago. Unfortunately, that blog was talking about moving from the Hotmail interface to the then new outlook.com interface. The only thing that is still relevant now is that you can add an @outlook.com alias to a Hotmail account. The rest of the article is not correct. Renaming an account has not been available for 3 years. Switching from the Hotmail interface to the outlook.com interface has not been available for 4 years. With the switch to Office 365 servers, Outlook Connector no longer works. The limits on the number of aliases and the number that can be added each year is now 10.

" Hi,  Thank you for the reply and update.  You can for sure go ahead with the updates installation to keep the pc up to date. Updates are additions to software that can help prevent or fix problems, improve how your computer works, or enhance your computing experience.  Further you may also run a full computer virus scan to ensure the computer is free from virus. It is not advisable to access the registry before the virus scan is done.  A fast way to check whether your PC has a virus is to use Windows Defender. This malware protection is included with Windows and helps identify and remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. Once this is done you may also check for any pending updates and install the same to see if that helps.  How do I find and remove a virus?: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/getstarted-protect-your-pc  Note: There could be a loss of data while performing a scan using Microsoft safety scanner to eliminate virus if any.

"Hi Timothy,   Good Day!   We understand that you wish to control your status on your account. Please be advised that using Skype for iOS, Skype automatically set your status for you. When you are signed in and online, your status will show ACTIVE NOW.    When you are signed out or offline, your status will show LAST SEEN and how long ago you were online.   If you would prefer to hide your presence status completely, you can change this in your profile settings. Tap your profile picture > Tap the Settings button > Tap Privacy > then you can toggle Show my presence to others on or off.   You still have control over when people can contact you. Turning off the Notification for conversations option will show your presence as Do Not Disturb, which lets your contacts know you aren't currently available.    This will also stop all incoming message notifications, however, you will still receive Skype calls.

"Hello Christina R. Pain Management,   Welcome to Skype Community forum.   In my experience, Skype is best when using a Windows desktop or laptop (I’m not sure for other Skype users).   You can do free Skype-to-Skype calls and video calls. You can also start Group video calling with your family, friends and colleagues. And it is also free!   Instant messaging is also possible and free of charge. Group chat is also available.   You can do Screen sharing with your colleagues and this is also free.   You can also call mobile number, you need to have a Skype Credit or a calling subscription with this.   There are also paid services that Skype offers, however Skype is designed for personal use only. You may want to check Skype for Business for you to use it for your business.

"Hi Ruwim, I understand the renaming behaviour is intentional (and very useful) in Explorer, the problem is with Skype window that tells you ""file received"" and you get the first version when you click directly on the link to open it instead of the last file received. This has happened to me, someone sent me a report document that was changed but couldn't find any changes when opened via Skype and missed important information of the report that was added. Now I have to warn everyone that they need to right-click the file, select ""Show in folder"" and open the last file received via Explorer (that shows correctly the renamed file), this is annoying and time wasting. IMHO it would be more useful to create new folders with name of the folder based on date and time (e.g. ""2017_09_28_14_35_58"") where new files can be received and if they have the same name, Skype should report the renamed version, this way Skype received files would not contain lots of obsolete files received from other people which makes finding the last received file even more difficult.

"Hi,  Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.  I understand that you are unable to reinstall the Bing desktop.  I will certainly help you with this.  If a Bing app is removed when one or more Bing apps are running, the shared content for all currently installed Bing apps may be corrupted.  I would suggest you to go through the below methods:  Method 1: Try to perform clean boot:  A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7, or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.  How to perform a clean boot in Windows  http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135  Note: Refer ""How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.

(Also update the BIOS and chipset drivers.)  DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more. http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html  For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.  Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.  Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)  Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.  Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.  Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.  Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites. http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm How to Install a Device Driver in Vista Device Manager http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html  If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then go look for new ones manually if you wish.

"Hello, I am currently experiecing the following issues with the Bing Health & Fitness App for windows phone 8 - For the Diet Tracker - UK based food auto entries seem to have been removed. When adding a food item in the serach foods box I used to get auto complete suggestions that including UK centric food. These seem to have been missing sometime between Fri 19 Sept to Sun 21 Sept. Initiating the diet tracker, adding items and loading up previous days food seems to take a very long time. I have timed adding one food item can take up to 3 minutes (even when connected to Wifi). Adding items into the connect Health Vault account via the internet (not from a mobile device) do not appear back on the Health and Vault WP8 app. For the Excercise Tracker - After entering an excercise the data does not seem to have been logged when th app navigates back to the excercise summary. However, on exiting to the home page and then navigating back to the escercise traker the entries can been seen. As well as these points (the missing UK food entries being the most fustrating) I have previoulsy sent feedback in regards to possible improvements via the WP8 app. These are: Function to group food into a meal. For example being able to group all the individual items for a particular meal that I eat on a regular basis would help tremendously. Enable flow of entries udpated in health vault to the Bing Healt and Fitness WP8 app would be very useful. Speed up the application - when selcting the wrong food entries and hitting the back button, rather than clearing the last serach and having to type again leave the last search in place reduce the amount of data that has to be loaded on each page, why can't some of the data be held temp  locally on the WP8 device.

"Hi , this is Sarah from the Microsoft Community. Lets see if we can get your problem resolved. Since the computer already comes with a valid license for Windows 7, I would just perform a factory reset and set it up with a new user account. New computers that come preinstalled with Windows often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to boot into when you start your computer by pressing a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9, F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key. Consult the owners manual that came with your PC for instructions about how to reinstall Windows. This is how the recovery partition is accessed for the most popular makes.. For Dell, press CTRL + F11 directly after powering up the unit For HP, press F11 directly after powering up the unit For LG, press F11 directly after powering up the unit For Toshiba, press and hold '0' BEFORE and during the power up For Acer, press and hold ALT + F10 as soon as you see the logo For Asus, press F9 as soon as you see the Asus logo. For Samsung, press F4 at power up.. For Fujitsu, press the F8 key repeatedly directly after powering up For Advent, restart your computer. Then Press F10 repeatedly until the message ""Starting System Recovery"" is displayed For Sony VAIO, restart and press ""F8"" or ""F10"" repeatedly until the ""Advanced Boot Options"" screen appears.

But every time I make a change to the file, it now drops the Read access and gives ""No Access"" to everyone else.  When I go to the server and change the permissions back to Read, it stays that way until I make another change and then wipes out the Read access again.  It is consistent across Excel files--not unique to a certain one.  And Word works fine.  It doesn't change permissions on Word docs I save in the same folders. This has been happening for a couple months; restarting doesn't make a difference.

"The problem isn't that the application installation is corrupted it is that there is a bug in the program. It affects all the systems that I have (1 PC, 1 Phone and 1 Tablet) and the problem also is if I use it without the application at all but login to a webpage to use the diet tracker - i.e. MSN Health & Fitness.  It's a programming bug. You can use the 'Recent' list and the 'Custom' list no problem. However the 'Favorites' list screws up the entries - even on the website with no app installed. Also there are favourites that are left over from when it used the 'Health Vault' that cannot be deleted or used so that causes problems as well.  For example: If I login to the MSN Health and Fitness and then select, 'Chicken Fillet Classic - Subway' from my favourites menu, then nothing happens - I cannot use the item and I cannot delete it either.  Another example: If I use the Windows 8.1 App it does let me select the 'Chicken Fillet Classic - Subway' however when it populates the data in to the 'Lunch' field the carbs, protein and fat data is all zero and the Calories information is wrong. Once this happens reselecting the item from 'recent' then reproduces the error. So for the moment the 'Favourites' menu is bugged. My wife has the same problem which is a pity because the app has tons of potential.

"God, I really wish someone else was trying to help too, cause I'm frankly stumped. Just to find out if I am mostly wrong or totally wrong, can you try an experiment for me? Do the Ctrl-Alt-Del thing and open task manager, click on processes and then select Excel.  Then do your sort and see if Excel's memory usage goes nuts. Granted, if it doesn't I have no idea what the problem is, and if it does I don't know what the cause of the memory issue would be, but my ""first rule of troubleshooting,"" is narrow the cause down. OK, that isn't true, my first rule is ""shut up and reboot,"" but that doesn't apply here ;) At this point I'd even appreciate a microsoft employee on the thread, they wouldn't do anything, but maybe someone who knows something would then show up to correct them...  Other questions on the ""narrow it down"" theme: What happens if you copy the worksheets in the workbook to a new workbook and save it, and then try to sort the new workbook? Similar trick, copy the cells that you are trying to sort and paste (probably paste values) them into a new workbook and sort there? What version of Office are you using? Does this only happen when you sort by one particular column, or does it happen regardless of which column you sort by? If it is only one column, what else is happening in the column? Do you have another workbook with a similar sized chunk of information (40 columns) that you can try to sort to see if it is just the one workbook/set of data or if it is a general your copy of excel problem? Does the number of rows you can sort by change if you just select some of your columns and sort them (don't save just in case it does work, but...)?  I routinely do sorts on workbooks that I have to move from Excel 97 format to modern excel format because the 65K row limit is less than my number of rows, so this one is surprising to me.

"The following macro embeds all Shapes & InlineShapes in a document in tables as InlineShapes with a row for Captions. Whatever positioning applied to the original Shape object will apply to the table also. As coded, the ‘MakeImageTable’ macro limits the inserted InlineShape dimesnsions to 7.5*5.0cm. That code can, of course, be edited/omitted, in which case, so too can the corresponding code that re-sizes the inserted InlineShape to fit.  To have the caption row appear above the image, instead of below, change the Rows(1) references to Rows(2), change the Cell(1, 1) references to Cell(2, 1) and change the change the Cell(2, 1) references to Cell(1, 1).

"Hello,  Thank you for visiting Microsoft Community.   As per the description, I understand that you’re facing issues using Internet Explorer. I will certainly help you with the issue.   I would suggest you to follow the steps mentioned below:   Method 1: I would suggest you to run virus scan to make sure the computer is free from virus. The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove virus, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software. http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx   Note: 1) The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.                                                               2) If you run the virus scan the program that is infected with virus will get deleted. So you have to reinstall the program. Also if the files and folders are affected with virus then they might even get deleted. Method 2: Refer to the link mentioned below and check if it helps:     Method 3: If the issue does not resolve try to reset the internet explorer and check the issue. Change or reset Internet Explorer settings    Disclaimer: The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also reset parental control settings. We recommend that you note these sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature. Resetting Internet Explorer isn't reversible, and all previous settings are lost after reset.   Hope this information helps.

"Just noticed you'd responded to this.  What that typically means is that the ""6""key on your keyboard appears to the system as pressed, possibly either stuck in the down position or somehow shorted by something that dropped into the area below the keys.  Most often today this will be due to a liquid spill of something containing sugar or syrup, since this contains enough electrical conductivity to make the key appear to be pressed or otherwise simply cause the key to stick in a pressed position as it slowly dries.  Both the laptop I'm writing this on and the previous one had this happen at least once with lemonade, which eventually caused the sticky keys problem I described above.  The older model was so bad I ordered a replacement from Dell and replaced it myself, fortunately at a cost of only $29 plus shipping.  On this more expensive backlit laptop, I had the time to disassemble and remove the keyboard first, then used clean running water for several minutes to thoroughly flush out the spilled liquid, dry it completely using first a towel and then leaving it overnight to air dry.  One key does still occasionally stick slightly in humid weather, making an audible squishing sound, but not enough to truly cause more than minor annoyance.  It's possible the problem is just something metal under the keys,  but most laptops today don't allow for this, so that's why I'd suspect a liquid spill as most likely.

"If you can print a test page from the printer, at least the printer's hardware seems to be functioning.  When you mentioned that you can't print a test page from within ""Device Manager"" do you really mean from the ""Devices and Printers"" window?  That is, the usual method for printing test pages is to right-click on a printer's icon in ""Devices and Printers,"" select ""Printer properties"" and use the ""Print test page"" button from the ""General"" tab of the ""Printer properties"" dialog.  The HP LaserJet Pro p1102 is one of HP's lower-cost ""host-based printers.""  This means that the computer itself is used to perform all of the print processing.  I'm not very familiar with this type of printer, but I'll try to help you out.  Open Devices and Printers If you go to Control Panel > Programs and Features (click Start, type Programs and Features in the Search box, and press Enter), what HP software is listed there?  Although you didn't specifically say so, it sounds as if you have at least one other printer installed on this computer.  Is that an HP printer also?  Microsoft used to have an automated ""Fixit"" routine that solved a great many printer problems.  The article describing the Fixit is still online at https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2793718/you-experience-print-spooler-error-messages-after-installing-or-upgrad  Like much of Windows 7 support, however, Microsoft ""retired"" this Fixit, as you will see if you click the buttons on that page.  Fortunately, the ""guts"" of that routine were saved by the Microsoft Print Team and are still available, although things are not quite as automated as they once were.   The Fixit has two modes, Light and Full.  Although I suspect that the Light mode will not fix your problem, it won't adversely affect your system and you may want to try it while I'm waiting for your response to the above questions.  The Full mode may well solve your problem although it's primarily intended for the more usual printer-based printing problems.  I haven't used it on a system with a host-based printer, but it should work here as well.  The catch with the Full mode, however, is that it removes all printers, even those that are now working properly.  All printers would have to be freshly installed.  That's one of the reasons I asked if you had other printers installed.  Here are directions to using the Fixit  (note that if you don't include a parameter such as -light after the name of the script, you'll get a full description of what the script does in both light and full modes):   ",6,0.5679614359714453,0.9228586026131768,True,False,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,6,0.75,1721,145,132,False,False,False,False,0.029,0.89,0.08,0.9689

Somehow I have solved it.   I went to the properties of a file saved as .ppsx which would open in power point in the edit mode instead of opening as a slide show.

I saw that the icon had changed slightly and saw that the icons of all my .ppsx files had slightly changed and all the .ppsx files now open as a slide show and no longer in PP as an edit file.   Don’t know what happened but think that when you work in Power Point and save the file as a.ppsx it really does not save it as a.ppsx but as a .pptx (as it says it must in the Options in the PP program!!) by changing how it opens afterwards it has magically adopted the.ppsx and changed all the files with that suffix to open as shows!

"I recently bought a new computer and had a computer store tech support guy install Windows 7 Professional for me.  When I started using the machine, I noticed there was a folder with the name 'Owner' in the Users folder.  I have never created a user with the ID 'Owner'. What's more, there is no folder in the Users folder for the user ID I first logged in with (my last name).  When I tried to remove the 'Owner' folder (none of its subfolders have any useful content), I get a response asking: ""Are you sure you want to permanently delete this folder?"", and on the next line, it lists the ID of the user I have been logging in with (my last name)!  Maybe it was the tech guy's choice to rename the Users folder that goes with my ID as 'Owner'.  Is there a way I can replace the name 'Owner' for this folder with the user name the folder is actually associated with?  If so, how? If anyone knows how to d this, pleae let me know. Thanks!

The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove virus, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software. http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx  Note: 1) The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.  2) If you run the virus scan the program that is infected with virus will get deleted. So you have to reinstall the program. AlAmyso if the files and folders are affected with virus then they might even get deleted.

"I embed hyperlinks in an excel file pointing to some folders in google drive. It worked perfectly well in the past. In these few days, when I tried to click these links, it prompts ""unsupported browser"". I tried IE11, Edge, Firefox and Chrome but still same problem. I checked with Google support team this morning. - We tried creating a new excel spreadsheet and embed the link but same problem. - We copied the hyperlink to the browser and it worked. Hence, they confirmed it is not the problem of the link itself - We tried the hyperlink in google spreadsheet and it worked. Hence, they identified that it is the excel problem.

"Hi , To connect your computer to a television, your computer needs to have a video port that matches one of the inputs on your television. If your television does not have a VGA or DVI input that matches an output on your computer, you will need to use composite video or S-Video cables.  If your computer doesn't have any of these TV-compatible outputs, then you might be able to install a new video card that has the right connection. You will need a HDMI cable to connect TV with laptop. Follow these steps to connect your computer to your TV: 1. Turn off your computer and position it within easy reach of your TV. Disconnect the monitor, but leave the mouse and keyboard connected. 2. Connect the appropriate video cable from your computer's output to your TV. 3. Turn on your TV and set it to the input that matches the output on your computer. You might need to refer to the user's guide included with your TV for instructions on how to do this. 4. Turn on your computer. You should see Windows displayed on your TV. If the screen looks stretched, or part of the screen seems cut off, you probably need to adjust the screen resolution in Windows. http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Getting-the-best-display-on-your-monitor If you can't see Windows on your TV, you might need to reconnect the computer to your monitor and adjust the screen resolution before you connect to your TV. http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Connect-your-computer-to-a-TV http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/HDTV-frequently-asked-questions Check the display settings. Follow these steps: 1. Click Start and click Control Panel and then click on Personalization. 2. Click on Display Settings. 3. Under Display Settings click the Settings Tab. 4. Then Select the 2nd monitor display from the drop down under Display. 5. Put a checkmark against “Extend my Windows Desktop onto this monitor”. 6. Click on Apply and then click the Advanced Button. 7. Click the Graphics card tab that is installed on the computer, for example, Intel Graphics media Accelerator, and then click the Graphics properties button under Advanced. 8. Next, under the Display devices select Television as Single Display and under Multiple Display Select primary device as television and secondary device as  notebook or laptop. 9. Click on Ok on all the windows to close the Display properties. Regards, AfzaClairerosoft Support.

"Thanks for the reply Stephanie, This problem has existed for quite a while both in Win 8.1, where I clicked the ""Send Feedback"" button within the app to explain the problem and also in Win10 where I clicked on the Smiley Face to provide Windows Feedback of this problem in the Weather App. In the feedback I explained the problem in some detail and was advised, when I submitted the Feedback, that I would not get a response and Thank You. I assumed that someone at Microsoft (MS) monitors the feedback and investigates the problems.  In both cases I waited to see a fix and after months, never saw the fix. I have looked at other cities and it appears that historical data is correct, just not for Payson. When I saw online that Microsoft identified the vendors who provide the data for the weather app, I contacted the source for historical information and they responded in an email to my problem. Payson is not one of the cities that they provide data for and their research indicated that the Payson historical info was the same as Scottsdale. They suggested that this is a Microsoft App problem and that I should contact Microsoft. Knowing that no results were achieved when reporting through ""Send Feedback"" within the App I thought it might be appropriate to send a request to the Microsoft Community and hope some one would read my problem. Glad I was heard and you replied to the problem. I have validated the error on 3 PCs, two of which are running Win 10 and one on Win 8.1. All give the same incorrect results. I attempted to run the ""troubleshoot problems"" script, but it failed because it does not yet work on Win 10. Regardless I don't think the problem is on my computers but in the way the Application is programmed to provide historical data when a city does not have information from a source.

"Hi Rich,  To link or embed an Excel worksheet in Word, there are three ways to copy objects:   The last two are known as Object Linking and Embedding (OLE). The main differences between linked objects and embedded objects are where the data is stored and how you can update the data after it’s inserted in your presentation.  When a chart is embed using Microsoft Excel chart objects, it will retain their Excel characteristics and when they are embedded into Word and then edited, Excel will be the editor.  Use Destination Theme & Link Data, this is the default paste option (Ctrl+V); it Keeps the chart linked to the original workbook.

"Hi My system is as follows: * Nokia Lumia 2520 (note, this is a tablet, not a mobile phone) * Windows RT I have the above tablet and purchased the keyboard to accompany it; the keyboard incidentally has a battery which complements the main battery in the tablet.  Prior to a recent full system refresh, the battery meter displayed both on the Windows 8 interface, but also in the notification area of the desktop recognised and displayed both batteries and gave a sensible total percentage charge.  For example, when both the tablet and keyboard batteries are quite fully charged, the overall charge is displayed as 100% or slightly less. However, since the full system refresh, the overall charge percentage is making little sense.  For example, at the current time, charge percentages are as follows: * Tablet battery: 100% * Keyboard battery: 1% * Overall charge: 13% I am aware that the tablet battery provides significantly more battery time than the keyboard battery and so am confused as to why the overall charge displayed is so low. Prior to the full system refresh, I am very sure that in the scenario above for the tablet and keyboard battery charges, the overall charge would have more logically been far higher, perhaps at least 80%. I did notice that the overall charge status in terms of 'plugged in/ charging/ not charging' seems to report the status of the keyboard battery, rather than the tablet battery and wonder if the battery meter is somehow inappropriately prioritising the keyboard battery, which is essentially a 'slave' battery. Would anybody therefore know why the above would be occurring and also perhaps how Windows RT tends to handle dual batteries? I can confirm that as of 19/01/16, system update confirms the tablet is fully up to date, so I would assume that any previous fixes that may have been implemented are already installed.

"Once again, i must appeal to the wisdom and kindness of the clever-user community. I translate lots of PowerPoint presentations from French. These are sometimes full of quotation marks, which in French traditionally look like this: « wibble » I want to make them look like this: “wibble”. Basically, i want to change [guillemet + space] or [guillemet + non-breaking space] to [“] (a sixty-six quote mark). Back in the day, in an earlier version of PPT, i could just use Find&Replace to change, e.g., [« ] to [“]. (In Word, that is still the case). It would take seconds to do it; now it takes minutes. The Find feature in PPT does not distinguish between « "" and “. In fact, enter [«] in the search box in the top right of the window and it finds most cases of "" and “ but NOT «. Use the Find&Replace box, and it detects a different wrong set of characters. It is a complete mess. I tried a macro that contains the line: oRng.Characters.Replace Chr$(174), ""§"" (the idea being to subsequently change § to “) Chr$(174) being theoretically [«] – but it doesn't pick up on any instances. (BTW the code works when applied to other characters). Have i just got the wrong character code? How can i find out? Is there no easy way of checking the code for each character in VB? If not, can anyone see what has to be done to get PPT or VBA to recognize [« ] so it can be turned into [“] ? Sorry to be so long - thanks for reading this far!

"The direct answers to your initial 3 questions are:  A couple of points:  First & foremost: Objects cannot be inserted into cells... period. What Jessica attempted to describe as well as any other 'tutorials' you find may be well-intended but are a misrepresentation of what actually is being done. Essentially, the object can be locked into position on a sheet so that it appears to be contained within a cell. In truth, the object still floats on the surface of the sheet.  Second: Keeping the object anchored in place requires 2 conditions:  As you've found, however, with Protection enabled the object icon is rendered as a static graphic & cannot be opened.  Although it isn't exactly what you want, the only option I can suggest is to insert a Hyperlink to the document in a cell... An icon could be included as well with the Hyperlink in an adjacent cell. The Hyperlink will work even when Protection is enabled to preserve the positioning of the icon.

Skype is always making improvements, such as enhanced quality, better reliability, and improved security. Because we want everyone to experience the best Skype has to offer, it's sometimes necessary to retire older versions of Skype, and Skype enabled devices.

"Hi!.  I think the workaround is a good idea if you have plenty of time and not a lot of graphics.  I'm working on a major document project requiring close to 600 graphics in the next month...   so this workaround is not going to be useful and would actually double the workload - not to mention would probably be better if (ugh) i just create originally in powerpoint (not fond of).

"Hi Brett,  Strange as this may sound, it's actually good news.  If you don't know already, Microsoft has been testing a new Visual Basic for Applications Editor for Office for Mac in Insider Fast builds. The test was very successful and everyone loves the new editor. The only remaining part that needs to finished for the editor is the Userform editor component. That there is suddenly a new glitch in userforms is a strong indication that Microsoft is working on UserForms now. So this makes me very happy.  Of course, this is a big pain for you, and I can understand your scowl at my happiness.  Steven pointed to Ron's thread. Ron submitted a bug report to Microsoft, and you should, too. Use the Smile button in Excel and send a frown. The squeaky wheel gets the grease!  Meanwhile, for your production environment, I'd say restore the most recent build that worked right (probably 15.37) using Time Machine. Choose Keep Both. Also, turn AutoUpdate to manual, so it doesn't trash your restored version of Excel.  While I can't promise that running two different versions of Excel won't cause other strange behaviors, it's the best I can offer you for now. In theory, you shouldn't even be able to do this, because Office should be doing a checksum to make sure the install hasn't been tampered with. But it seems to work, anyway.",3,0.43649448292998916,0.8381872725889669,False,False,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3,0.3,944,119,109,False,False,True,False,0.026,0.858,0.116,0.9547

"Hi StephanieSkypeUser and welcome to the Skype Community! Password reset codes are sent by the system for verification that the user requesting access to the account is the true account owner. Skype support cannot send the reset code for your password manually, as this will be sent by the system automatically to the registered security information of your account (which in your case are the two email addresses) if the owner requests a password reset.   Since you have access to the second email address of the account, you can try deleting a few spam or junk emails which you no longer deem important, The reset code will be sent once so you do not have to worry that you'll be spammed. After you successfully reset your password and signed in to your account, I advice that you update your security info and include your third email address to the list of your security info so you can use this email to reset your password. Please refer to this link for additional details.    Let us know if you need further clarification/assistance.    Thank you.

"Hello TylerFogg,     We want to create the best possible app experience for our Skype users which means we must make some changes along the way. These decisions are hard to make but will enable us to focus our efforts on transitioning Skype from a peer-to-peer video and chat app to a modern, mobile friendly cloud architecture.    Skype on the cloud means you can access all of your chats and shared images on any device with the same Skype account and consume less battery power.   With these, we can no longer get back to the older version of Skype for iPad 6.35.1.   Alternatively, you can uninstall and reinstall Skype for iPad.   To uninstall Skype for iPad, simply touch and hold the Skype icon on your home screen until the icon begins to shake and an “x” appears in the corner of the Skype icon. Release the icon and then tap the “x”. This will delete Skype from iPad. Reboot your device. Reinstall Skype from the App Store and do another reboot before signing back in to Skype.   Hope this helps. Let me know if you need further assistance.   Thank you!

I did this experiment again, only this time I inserted slide numbers AFTER I copied the slides over. It was slightly better in that one of the two slides I copied in added a slide number. I tried variations on copying in slide 4 that were very simple slides with nothing in the bottom part of the slide that might interfere with a header. This did not work.

" I think the way the original problem was described isn't addressed by a driver issue.    Basically, if I have a window open (custom sized, not maximized), and I switch between portrait and landscape mode -- the screen will shrink to fit the portrait view, but will not return to the original size when rotated back to landscape view.    Especially more annoying, is that the window doesn't need to be visible -- any open applications (minimized) also get resized to fit portrait, but not resized to the original size when rotating back to landscape view.    I suspect this would be a feature request (because I can't find any setting that would yield this behavior -- and it means it'll likely never be implemented.)  It's extremely annoying, particularly because I often have a dozen or so apps open, and when I rotate, all of them are resized.

"Hello. As a relatively new Excel user (Excel for Mac v. 15.3), I am struggling with what I thought would be a simple problem. I have a table with multiple columns, each of which contains a list of selected integers between 1 and 340. These represent case numbers in an audit, with each column containing only those numbers which are positive with respect to the particular criteria defined by that column - so the values are never repeated within the same column.  I want to copy the value in each cell of the column to a new column, but with the row number defined by the value in that column. (Only alternate columns A, C, E are filled, leaving B, D, F etc. for the returned results). So, for example, if the first three cells A1, A2, A3 in column A contain the values 83, 41, 279, I want the formula to return the values 83, 41, 279 into cells B83, B41 and B279 respectively. It doesn't matte that the intervening cells will be blank.  I then want to repeat the exercise for column C into column D, E into F etc.  If there is a way to do it for the whole spreadsheet at once that would be great, but even if i have to do one column at a time that would be acceptable.

"Hi Crystal: My name is Ron. Yes your question does make sense. It is a good idea to re-install Windows on a ""new used"" computer that you get from someone else. Re-installing Windows wipes out all of their files, any potential malware they may have picked up and it gets rid of any software they installed that you don't need. Before you do it, it is always a good idea to backup the data files at the very least to some other location. Better yet, it is a good idea to make an ""Image copy"" backup so that you have a ""known good"" point to restore to if you run into problems doing the windows install. Sorry, there is very little chance you can transfer your copy of Windows 8 to this computer. If Windows 8 came with the other computer, you simply cannot transfer it. What you can most likely do is use the build in ""recovery"" feature to reset your computer to ""factory fresh"". This short How to Video is pretty good: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA1LSmLwEfI NOTE: if you have any programs instaled you want to keep, ie Office, you need to make sure you have the ""Product Key"" or ""serial number"" you need to reintall those applications. As well you'll need the install files or disk. You can download up to Office 2007 from MS, other applications you'll have to check to see what they say. *********** If you find a reply has fixed your problem please click on the ""Accept this answer"" blue hyperlink button.

"Split from this thread. Ok im going to try my best to explain the table. So in this table is where i am doing possion distribution, as for the 0-0 cell this is the following formula, =((POISSON(0,J37,FALSE)*POISSON(0,$L$37,FALSE)))*100   0 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 3   +   4 This table has the same formula for each respective score so for example if the home team scored 3 and the away team scored 1 the formula would be as follows. I also labeled where it would be in the above table. =((POISSON(3,$J$37,FALSE)*POISSON(1,$L$37,FALSE)))*100 In conclusion I want the automation to take place when i type the team names in their respective home and away form and to have the above table values looked up, find the max number within the table and distribute the corresponding score for the home team and away team. So in this case I want the numbers above Liverpool and Burnley to read 2-0, Instead of 1-0 because the 12.80 is the highest number within table H26:N32. Sorry for another comment but i am trying to clear it up for you. For example, if the highest number is in cell L32 (in this case it is 1.45 obviously not the highest number) the score should read 4 goals for the home team (Liverpool) and 2 goals for the away team (burnley).",1,1.0000000000000002,0.949156420069856,False,True,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.2,831,76,71,True,False,False,False,0.011,0.912,0.077,0.8488

"Hi Julie and thanks for finally getting back to me. Amazing that Microsoft shoots itself in the foot by making it so much less attractive to bother giving customers what they want and need.  I now have no reason to use Skype number vs. Google number and I am now totally unhappy that I even paid for it.  Maybe this is one to bump up the chain to Microsoft - 1. The reason to get a skype number (and same reason people get a google number) is to have a VOIP replacement for a landline. One that potentially small consulting businesses like me might want to use as a face to clients. However, clients and in fact people, don't like to be reminded they are reaching a VOIP generic number. When you take the ability to personalize away, you defeat the purpose for some of us. Google knows this, why don't you?  2. Microsoft's customer service has frankly always been terrible and it seems to somehow be getting worse and worse. Skype has fallen down in it's ability to be what it used to be and partly for these two reasons. The fact that it can take weeks to get help or a response is appalling.   Frankly...These days I look at Microsoft and scratch my head wondering why you drive away customers by making it so difficult for them to love your services. Is Microsoft now only about selling volume in foreign countries and doesn't care at all about service?  As someone who's been in the tech industry for many years, watched the rise and now what looks like the fall that could be another rise if this attitude were fixed, I see so many opportunities missed by the company on all fronts. Why has Google risen and outstripped you? Giving the User what they want and need and with good service. Why have companies like Amazon won the market? Customer service and giving customers what they want and need with ease.  Looking down the line at services that are now filling the gap you have sitting right in the palm of your corporate hand...You will lose more and more of this market share unless you start paying attention. In taking away something as simple as the ability to have a personalized message to whoever calls me replaced my some generic message that makes people hang up...Let's just say you are alienating customers.  I will now stop paying you for what I can not use. A shame. Really a shame.  Please DO bump that up the chain. It'll probably go nowhere and fall on deaf ears, but frankly....I am now going back to not using Microsoft products the way I was.

"Hi Sarah  Thanks for the reply. I still think the behavior in Bing calculator is unexpected and should be fixed although I do recognize that there is a design choice to be made there. But in any case, both results should be consistent. The biggest problem however is that Bing calculator is not consistent within itself. Input in Bing calculator:  1/(10000000000000000000+1000000000000000000)  which gives the correct answer of:  9.09090909E-20  Copy and paste that value into Bing calculator and divide by 10  9.09090909E-20/10  and you run into the same issue as above. Bing Calculator's output can therefore sometimes not be used as input to Bing Calculator. Which should be fixed imo.

Column B has the dates of the events in it. Row 2 has the list of players in it. Cell C6 and all of the other events that have happened have a number in it, either 1, .75, .5, or 0.  In cell C3, put in a formula that adds up the player's attendances (numbers in the same column). In Cell C4, put in a COUNTA formula that adds up the number of cells in that column with something other than blank in it. In cell C5, put in a formula that divides C3 by C4.

"Helpful link, thanks.  Unfortunately I cannot give you the whole picture, or even anything like the whole picture, but some things to look out for:  a. the Sharepoint data types do not map all that well onto the Word content control types. (There are a lot more of the former, for one thing).  b. Some of the mapping, in particular the presentation choices, used to be better when the old Document Information Panel (DIP) was available, in the sense that the display *in the DIP* conformed better to the data type in Sharepoint. But I do not think for example you can present a multiple choice as a set of radio buttons in Word.  c. As far as I know, the current version of Word Online lets you see content controls (and even the content control Name tags) but does not let you edit their contents. I think you have to use an Office (Javascript) Add-in to do that. However, even that may depend on whether you are using the ""public"" version of Word Online or one hosted by a private SharePoint site, although I assume that the latter version always catches up to the former .  d. When you edit in Desktop Word, what Word actually looks at to try to validate the data in a content control is the XML schema that is generated by SharePoint and inserted along with the Server metadata. But the user does not necessarily get to see that they have invalid data until they click outside the control or try to save. But some of the constraints that you might think would be applied are not - for example, if you specify a multiline type in SharePoint, you can specify a maximum line count, and AFAIK you do not get to specify a character count limit. But when you enter a new line in a plain text content control in Word, what Word inserts is a hard line return, and the resulting lines do not appear to count as lines as far as SharePoint is concerned. Further, Word seems to impose a 255 character maximum whatever SharePoint allows.  e. Because the Word checkbox content control type was not one of the original types, SharePoint does not use it. (Although I think perhaps it should, now). So the obvious user interface element for Yes/No type values is not used. Instead, you get a dropdown that presents ""true"" and ""false"" choices, and theya re literally those choices because that's what gets sent in the XML.  f. As a general rule, indexed types are probably not going to work as you might like. e.g. a Lookup just presents a number, not the text actually referenced by the lookup. And I don't think stuff such as Person/Group or Managed MetaData types will work properly. **EDIT: At least some of the stuff that you used to be able to do in the DIP you can now do in BackStage in the Property editing area. In fact some of it is better in thte sense that you do get to see lookups etc. from SharePoint.",5,0.641336028171325,0.9382979886798807,False,False,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,5,0.7142857142857143,1932,187,169,False,True,False,True,0.011,0.912,0.077,0.9883

"As Debra's alluded to, whether you get the latest features will depend on which version of Office 365 you have.  Do you already have Morph as one of the options on the Transitions tab?  If not, then almost certainly you don't have a version of Office that receives feature updates.  If you do have Morph, then we're off to a good start.  Next step:  Go to File | Account and opt in to the Insider program, which allows you to receive new features early on, before they're more generally released; I'm fairly sure that 3D options are not yet generally out there.  Then force PowerPoint to update.  You may need to do this a time or three, quitting and restarting it in between.  That's what it took to get 3D and some of the other newer features to appear here.

"Our charity's website (https://JenniferAnn.org) is not showing correctly in Bing search listings. The site is properly configured with the title of ""Jennifer Ann's Group"" which is the name of our charity founded in 2006. However Bing has changed the listing to instead show ""Murder of Jennifer Ann Crecente - Official Site."" Unfortunately, yes, Jennifer Ann Crecente was murdered in 2006 and it was her death which prompted the formation of this 501(c)(3) organization but this does not excuse Bing unilaterally misrepresenting us in their search results. Our work is not focused on Jennifer's murder but rather helping other young people recognize and avoid abusive dating relationships. When people search for information about ""Jennifer Ann's Group"" they should be able to find our website - not be presented with an ""official site"" for Jennifer's murder. For two days we have sent multiple requests to Bing / Microsoft through their automated systems as well as to their Twitter accounts in an attempt to correct the manner in which our organization is being misrepresented. There has been no response. Is there an official process to correct this? Or a person who can assist? Is there a procedure we can follow to ensure this does not happen again? While we recognize that this may not seem like a significant issue to some, it is terribly frustrating and hurtful for those of us who miss Jennifer and are working every day to help other adolescents avoid her fate. The fact that Bing would ignore our content and replace our name with one of its own choosing is genuinely distressing and offensive. The work we do is very important to us and it is not acceptable for Bing to define our work like this.

"I was working on a large PowerPoint 2016 Mac program (1.24GB in size with Voice -over).  On my last run-through to check the final timing of the slides, something happened.  All the pictures on slides disappeared (The image part with relationship ID rid4 was not found in the file).  Some of the purely text files looked OK.  The reason the Powerpoint file was so large is that I had a voice-over narration for the whole presentation and it bombes when saving the very last slide.  Question:  is there a file size limitation for Powerpoint 2016 Mac  I have spent HOURS on this program getting the narration and slide timing just right, and to see it bomb on the slide 79 really troubles me.

"Hi Jee, Thank for your reply. I totally get that Skype is now integrated with Microsoft and my question wasn't really about tryng to creating a separate for Skype from Microsoft account. Also understand the Skype ID is system generated.  Could the ID not be in an (IMHO) more human friendly format though? Live:7..e (16 random digits and letters)? The practical user problem I'm trying to solve is how is this person found in a Skype directory by others?  Her name is very common so searching for that comes up with many matches so I assumed Skype ID would be used to differentiate but 16 random digits and numbers into Skype search is not very user friendly  I created the account on iPad. I expected to need an outlook live email to create it so had set a free one up. When creating the account I think i entered both a mobile phone number and outlook email during the sign up process but hard to recall.  How would i go about making the outlook email the ID then for an existing account?  It's not jumping out at me i the account section.

"Here, people can live in places that are physically remote by tens, many times hundreds of kilometres. Video calling when it became accessible, was a great improvement to social accessibility and a sense of validated contact.  Because of these obvious benefits, it has been enthusiastically used as a post-surgical checkup tool, an integral part of mental health outreach programs, the de-facto primary method of ordinary medical consultations, a way to augment the life experiences of students too young, or physically or financially impeded in ability to travel.   It's true that - as others have commented - Skype became the descriptive name for this practice, just as carbonated cola drinks are all ""Coke"" in the venacular or electric guitars were all ""Fenders"". That's indisputable proof of brand penetration.  And now - with much of that in shreds due simply to launch of an immature product - people are being told they should ""wait and see"" what the next upgrade brings. There's not even the offer of temporarily preserving the old system at (an arbitrarily suggested figure) say $2/month. It's genuinely incomprehensible, especially in the light of Skype being a brand of Microsoft - a company whose founder personally supports a strong charter of social improvements.

"Hi,  I would definitely replace Norton with Windows 8's built-in Windows Defender. I heavily recommend against the usage of Norton as an active antivirus. In addition to using Windows Defender as your primary antivirus, you can also pair it with Malwarebytes Free to run secondary scans when you so desire.

"The San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA) website home page has a title tag containing: San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA, transit, streets, taxi)  Alas, Bing (and Yahoo) search results produce a page title of San Francisco Municipal Railway - Official Site which is a title tag we last used over 5 years ago.

"Thanks for the link.  In it I saw: Are there any recommended alternatives?  Perhaps that explains why my laptop, which is a W10 OS-based system, is stable (or, at least, it's not ever crashed on me).  It's been long enough that I no longer recall, but I *believe* I downloaded WLM12 there before importing my email system from the then-XP based system I have at my desk.  It may be that I didn't notice and the at-the-time 8.0, upgraded to 8.1 and accidentally upgraded to 10 OS had the Mail cited above .  But it doesn't explain why I should have (now a total of 4, the latest being yesterday) total crashes.  That is, I get (which is very frequent, but not always crash-inducing) ""WLM did not shut down correctly"" or some variant, along with some variant of checking, restarting, recovering the database, or the like, the latest of which presented me with all of the standard directories under my name, all empty, and none of the sub-folders I'd so laboriously filled, again.  I've ""repaired"" (the process in the control panel which takes quite a while to accomplish) WLM12 several times, but if it helped, it doesn't ""stick"" and I'm facing another crash.  I have some difficulty believing that W7Pro, so stable that legions have resisted upgrading to 10, is the cause of these crashes.  Previously, in XP, I'd lose the general mailbox that I put all the 4 accounts I monitor into, but the independent 4 accounts all survived, frequently (see prior discussions under my name). This is far worse.  Aside from resigning myself to future laborious rescue missions (I can ""usually"" - it's so fragmented that after 4 reconstructions, I'm not really sure - find the emails and rebuild my directories), is there anything I can do to minimize the likelihood of recurrence?  Failing that, is there some other program which can provide the look and feel of Outlook Express and its successors without having to ditch W7Pro?  Thanks.

"In Microsoft excel how do you lookup a certain value in a row and then look up another value in that row and then count the amount of times that second value appears in the row is the question. So in other words, the first value identifies the row the second value identifies what to look for in that row then instead of returning that exact value it returns the amount of times that value shows up in the specific row.  Example: So lets say you have a workweek sheet and a workweek summary sheet. On the workweek sheet it highlights the workers and the work done at different times during the day. On the summary Sheet it uses that data to tell you who (Value 1)  did what assignment (Value 2) and how many times they did it (Adding it). Of course that person would be doing different things during the day so it needs to be able to tell the difference (case sensitive). It does not need to tell you what time they did it since its based on a week that would be unnecessary data it just needs to tell you how many times they did a assignment during that week. And since persons may change through out the week once you type in a name to search and work assignment it should auto change its total(automated system i am looking for) .  Example code that didn't work but this is what I came up with:  =MATCH(Summary!$G$2,INDEX(Tuesday!$B$2:$E$58,MATCH(Summary!A5,Tuesday!$A$2:$A$58),)) Summary!A5 = Would be the person I look for in a row. this is a vertical lookup of names ( summary sheet ) Summary!$G$2 = Would be the assignment to look for on the workweek sheet but this ( text to look at ) is on the ( summary sheet ) Tuesday!$B$2:$E$58 = Would be the assignments to search through ( workweek sheet ) Tuesday!$A$2:$A$58 = Would be the row of names to search through ( workweek sheet ) Its like a two way lookup but on the second look up it looks at the whole row and identifies all the matching values/text in the row and adds the amount of times they show up.",1,0.9999999999999998,0.86306410387656,False,False,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1,0.16666666666666666,1301,101,90,True,False,True,True,0.0,0.938,0.062,0.9457

"Hello Sammy,  Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.  I would like to know some information about the issue so that we could help you better.  What is the reason of performing factory reset?  I appreciate your efforts towards resolving the issue.  Before you perform factory reset, I would suggest you to perform startup repair from Windows recovery environment and check if it helps.  If you can't start (boot) your PC, follow these instructions to get to the ""Windows Recovery Environment"". You may need to connect a keyboard to complete the steps. Please follow these steps:  a. Do one of the following, depending on whether you have installation media (such as a DVD or USB flash drive):  - If you have installation media for Windows 8.1, start (or boot) your computer from the installation media. Insert the DVD or USB flash drive and restart your computer. If you see a message asking you to ""Press any key to boot from DVD or USB"", do so. If you don’t see the message, you might need to change the boot order in your computer's BIOS settings so that it first starts from the DVD or USB. When you see the ""Install Windows"" page, tap or click ""Repair your computer"" to start the ""Windows Recovery Environment"".  - If you don’t have installation media, use the power button to restart your computer three times. This will start the ""Windows Recovery Environment"".  b. In the ""Windows Recovery Environment"", on the ""Choose an option"" screen, click ""Troubleshoot"".  c. Click ""Startup repair"" and follow on-screen instructions.  Important Notes: Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.  I highly recommend backing up all of your important files and folders onto an external storage device before attempting any type of OS repair or upgrade.  You may create Windows 8.1 installation media from this link: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media  I hope this information helps.

"The Historical weather information for Payson Arizona is reported incorrectly in the MS Weather Application. MS reports that the historical data is provided by Weather Trends International. I have contacted them and they have advised that they have not provided Payson historical weather data to MS and also determined that the data appears to be the same as Scottsdale Arizona. It seems that there must be programming that looks for a close geographic city and provides that data as an accurate representation of the area. Payson is a mountain community located 5,000 feet above Scottsdale. Our climate is significantly different from Scottsdale with actual historical variance 10 to 20 degrees different on average from those shown in the MS Weather App. I assume that if the MS Weather App programming looks for close geographic cities, when the program does not have actual information from Weather Trends International, it is being repeated for many small cities across the country and perhaps the world. Why is this a big deal? Many folks looking for places to vacation or retire will look at the MS Weather app for Payson Arizona and assume that the current and historical data is accurate. When they see historical averages of highs and lows that are 10-20 degrees higher than the real actuals, they will assume Payson weather is like Phoenix and drop it from consideration. To others who live in smaller communities across the country, please check the historical temperature and rainfall data for accuracy.

"Hi Arman_cacao,      1. What is the make and model of your computer? 2. Was is getting charged till 100% earlier?   Some steps to confirm whether or not the issue is your batter.   There are a few simple things you can do to see if the problem is with your battery, your charger, or the connection (power port) on your motherboard.   a.     You’ll want to first remove the battery from your laptop. b.     Then verify the wall outlet you are using is fully functional with another electronic device. c.     Then connect your power cable to the charger, sometimes referred to as the brick, while inspecting the cable for any damage or exposed wires. d.     Then connect the charger to your laptop’s power port. e.     Power the computer on when using strictly AC power. f.     If your computer is working as intended then your battery is most likely headed for “battery heaven” and will need to be replaced.   If your computer does not work then there may be an issue with the charger or the power port on your computer. You will want to double-check all connections, and the power source (wall outlet) you are using. If the problem persists this may be a sign of a faulty charger or the computers power port.   You will also want to check the port on the computer, were your power cable plugs-in, ensuring that the power pin is not bent or damaged. If the issue appears to be with the cable you will need to obtain another cable for testing purposes. If the issue appears to be with the power port you will want to contact your computer manufacture for further assistance.

"DanielYasofsky, re:  ""is there an easy way to send an individual tab to their personal email address""  In older versions of Excel you can email a single worksheet by choosing ""Send to"" from the file menu.  However, Excel has been ""improved"" and that option, I believe is removed, (i don't know for sure as i don't rent my excel version). What you can do, is right-click the sheet tab and choose the option to copy the sheet to a new workbook and then email (via the file menu) a copy of the new workbook.

"Hello everybody,   This is my first question here, so I hope someone can help me out.  For a writing job I use a .dot file from the company I'm working for. It creates a bar of buttons that I can use to speed up workflow and use the right markup for publishing. It works perfectly in Word 2011 (Mac), but I recently updated to Word 2016 (Mac). In Word 2016 the .dot file will load, but the buttons won't work anymore. I do see the buttons under the Add-ins tab. The problem is that there are multiple drop-down buttons that won't work when I click on them. A single button (with a single action) does work. Is this a known issue? Is there any way to convert the .dot file? Or is there any other way to use the .dot in Word 2016?

"Hi Brittney,  Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.  Ideally, when you install a language pack or choose a different language other than your system language, most of the features are displayed in the modified language. However, there are a few system settings that might still show up in the base language. In that case, we might need to install the operating system afresh choosing the desired language.

Press Windows + X key in the Windows desktop and click Control Panel. b. Open Language. c. Click on Add a Language and then select a desired language (Example: English) and click Open. d.

"Hey everyone, thanks for a bit of your time. I've been having a bit of a rough time with my Mic and Sound not working properly. As mentioned above, I have an Inspiron 15 5000 2in1 laptop. A good bit of time ago, the default Realtek drivers were giving me issues (static noise while playing) so I changed to the default High Definition Audio Device drivers and all was good again. However, a few days ago, all of those drivers gave a ""Code 45"" error, describing how they weren't connected and the chosen device was an Epson projector I used a while ago (it's usually just at the bottom of the list unused). Now all of the sound and mic stopped working. I went into device managers, uninstalled the drivers, and restarted my device and they reappeared updated but still showed as disconnected but the Realtek ones somehow appeared again (hadn't been there before). I tried again but the Realtek ones prevailed but the High Definition Audio Device ones did not reappear. Currently, when I open up the sound card menu, I get two drivers or devices in Playback Devices. I get the same Epson Projector UD Device titled Speakers and the Realtek Audio titled ""Speakers/Headphones."" Under recording I have the Microphone and Stereo Mix both by Realtek listed. Currently, the Realtek is working perfectly fine but the mic in my earbuds (default apple ones) and the one in my laptop no longer detect any sound. I've run the trouble shooter for audio, recording, and hardware devices but none returned any issues. The audio one did seem to prefer the Microphone device over the Stereo Mix but neither work. At the moment, I get decent audio with only slight crackling but the mic still does not work. My reference for the mic working is the green bars in the sound menu and the voice detection in Discord. Less than a week ago, all of this was working and it has me stumped after several restarts, a system restore to 3 days ago, and much frustration.  I'm not particularly tech savvy so if I missed any important information that might help you come up with a solution, please do not hesitate to let me know and I will provide it to the best of my ability.

"Hi,   Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.   I can imagine the inconvenience you are experiencing and will certainly help you in the right direction to fix the issue. However, I would appreciate if you could answer a few questions to narrow down the issue in order to provide you with better assistance.   As per the issue description the space of your HDD get used up and no free space remains there even though you have limited apps installed. So, it seems that the issue is related to the HDD. I would suggest you to try the steps provided below and see if it helps you to fix the issue.    Method 1:  Step 1: Run Disk Clean Up  First, I suggest you to run Windows Disk Cleanup tool to clean your hard disk from all unnecessary files that might be causing this issue on your computer.  You may refer the steps in the article below to run disk clean up: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/delete-files-using-disk-cleanup#delete-files-using-disk-cleanup=windows-8  Step 2: Perform disk check  After successfully running Disk Cleanup tool, also run Check Disk to check the hard disk for errors if any and automatically repair them.    NOTE: The root drive has to be C: and the command may schedule a task at the system startup, if it does, then press Y to schedule a task and restart the computer to perform chkdsk.  Important:While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost  Method 2:Run Memory Diagnostics  I would also suggest you to run Windows Memory Diagnostics utility. Windows 8.1 includes built-in features to help you identify and diagnose problems with memory. Refer to the steps below: Method 3: Run a Malware Scan  The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software. Kindly follow the below steps to run the  Microsoft safety scanner. Important:Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.  Note: The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.  Hope this will fix the issue, if not let us know with the updated status and we will be happy to assist you further.

"Hello, I am currently using Office365 ProPlus with a current Version 1705 (Build 8201.2102 Click-to-Run) under Windows 7. We use a PowerPoint AddIn to add extensive functions to PowerPoint. With the current version one function in our AddIn has stopped working and throws an error. The same function works fine in PowerPoint Version 1701 (sorry, don't have the exact Build number). What the AddIn is trying to do is adding a Tab Stop within the cell of a table. I already found out that the Tab Stop works fine with regular text fields. The problem only occurs within a table. Can anybody else confirm this problem? Is this a known bug and it's being worked on? Or is this an intended behavior? If so, is there a workaround for this? I can still manually (so not with VBA) add a tab stop to a cell, so in general PowerPoint still offers this functionality. If you want to check this behavior in your version, first create an empty new presentation. Change the layout to ""Empty"". Add a text field and name it ""text"" in the selection and visibility pane. Add a table (1 column, 2 rows) and name it ""table"". Afterwards you can add this code: Option Explicit                         Public Sub TabStopsTest()     Dim pres As Presentation     Dim shpTable As Shape     Dim shpText As Shape      On Error GoTo errhandler      Set pres = ActivePresentation     Set shpTable = pres.Slides(1).Shapes(""table"")     Set shpText = pres.Slides(1).Shapes(""text"")      'this works for a normal text field     shpText.TextFrame.Ruler.TabStops.Add ppTabStopRight, 200      'but throws an error within a table     shpTable.Table.Cell(1, 1).Shape.TextFrame.Ruler.TabStops.Add ppTabStopRight, 200      'however, changing the text within the cell works correctly     shpTable.Table.Cell(1, 1).Shape.TextFrame.TextRange.Text = ""test""     Exit Sub errhandler:     MsgBox Err.Number & "": "" & Err.Description, vbOKOnly End Sub Thanks in advance for any insight to this problem.",1,1.0000000000000002,0.9684810683883204,True,True,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1,0.25,1492,128,118,True,True,False,False,0.085,0.881,0.034,-0.9187

"Bumping this up. I've had ongoing problems since 16 May. Two IWDAud_Devices load over and over and over again. When they do, the screen goes black for a second, if I'm online, Mozilla Firefox will either crash or hang. I hit Escape to get them to stop. But they always come back. Another forum told me this is related to the Windows update KB3022345, which is causing problems for many computers. What I've Done: Updated Firefox. Refreshed Firefox. - NO EFFECT. Checked for Registry errors and fixed them with Ccleaner. Checked for updates to devices and drivers Changed updates setting to NOT automatically load. Did a microsoft security scan - no issues Checked plugins - all updated Ran a System Restore but the updates reloaded. Attempted to install Intel WiDi Update but it failed because my system does not support it. Ran deep scans for malware 2x - nothing detected. Used MalwareBytes. Produced a CBS log but can't get it interpreted. Did a DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth command. No effect. and other things I don't recall over the last 7 days, including reading a bunch of logs supplied to me on this forum.

All in order to get the latest Android Marshmallow with the new mobile, so I can continue using Skype; which doesn't operate on my Note II anymore using Android 4.4.2 Kit Kat !!  Of course I've tried upgrading my Galaxy Note II to install Marshmallow which is another expense in terms of time & effort and I hit the inevitable problems causing my Note II to crash with the inevitable business of having to flash a tar file of KitKat ( to get my Samsung Galaxy Note II working again ) using Odin. Not a pleasant experience after being up most of the night - trying to upgrade it.  Anyway I'm not impressed with Skype's attitude to all this - as in my opinion they could have quite easily continued to support Skype users using Android 4.4.2 KitKat by coming out with a Skype Lite version of Skype for mobile users like myself who are quite happy with their Note II mobiles.

"The issue isn't ""random"" :-) It is that the built-in list Styles in Word include a .5"" Left Indent for the list item text. If the number of items goes beyond single digits that Indent often is not enough which causes the Indentation to go to the next available tab stop - especially when larger font sizes are applied. By default, that tap stop is at 1' which is what causes the gap.  There are several ways to adjust it. One option is to simply use a smaller font size, but based on how you've constructed the list it seems the better way may be to: Another option would be to do as above, but as step #5 just change the Number Position to Right (or Centered) rather than Left.

"I am working on creating MapPoint maps by linking them to Excel tables. These tables contain a lot of data which makes the maps I created cluttered and not easy to visualize information on. To solve the issue, I'm thinking about using a slicer to make the Excel tables display only part of the rows at a time and have the maps only display the data selected with the help of the slicer. I believe that it could be possible to do that by adding a COM add-in to MapPoint and writing code to tell MapPoint to only display on the map the data filtered in the Excel table using the slicer.

If the language, according to the Language Bar setting, is English, then words typed into the email will be auto-corrected to English, regardless of the language used while typing the email.

"PROBLEM: I have email addresses in an Excel file (Mac 2016). When I click on them I get the alert - ""Cannot open specified file"" Does anyone know how to make proper clickable email links that will allow them to open up in my Mac Mail program? Not as critical, but I also have a column of website links that I'd like to turn into clickable links. They already have the proper http formatting. http://google.com (for example) BACKGROUND NOTES: Initially I was copying and pasting the email addresses into Excel. At that point they were clickable. But the font formatting and font sizes were all over the place. So I selected the entire column and clicked Edit > Clear > Formats. This cleaned things up nicely. But the underline and blue text highlighting disappeared. I assumed that they were not clickable at that point (that is debatable now) so I found some forum thread that explained how to format them back as clickable emails. It's been weeks since I did it, but I think that I may have highlighted the column and clicked ""fn"" and ""F2"" at the same time. Could be wrong about that. After doing some more research I noticed that if I hover over the cell it shows an address that looks like this: file://///NoServer/*** Email address is removed for privacy *** (for example). It should probably be mailto:*** Email address is removed for privacy *** (for example) but I don't know how to fix them.

" Hi Chad,  If you’re having issues with your keyboard, it can be due to an incompatible driver or broken system components after installing the update.  Let’s isolate this concern by performing a clean boot. This troubleshooting technique will help us identify if there are applications that’s causing your keyboard not to work accordingly. Please click here for the instructions. Once you’re in the clean boot state, try to check the performance of your keyboard if the issue has been resolved.  Note: After the troubleshooting, refer to this section: “How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting” on the same support article to boot the computer in normal setup once the issue has been resolved.  If you’ll get the same result, try to install the latest Windows 10 Creators Update Build that may contain possible fixes and enhancements. Check this article to find out and install the latest Build.  Additionally, you can search and install the Satellite S50-C keyboard driver from the manufacturer’s website.

"Brenda,  Here are some answers: 1. Is the issue only related to one specific ppt file or all files? Do you store them in cloud storage or local drive? I just started using PP 2016 for MAC, and have only created two files; one was an earlier saved version of the same PP file (just in case). Both files became corrupted. They are stored locally, on my internal hard drive, not on a peripheral drive or on off-site server. 2. When do you encounter this issue, after some Office or Mac OS updates? No MAC OS updates occurred and I'm pretty sure PP was not updated. I was just working on the files. I have a 500GB internal drive, which is down to 45GB, and I thought maybe that affected it. There were a number of other applications open.3. Is this ppt created on your Mac or other devices? The PPT was created only on the MAC.  I was going to convert it to Keynote so I could play it on my iPad.  It might just be better to use PP in its native setting (on a PC).

"Hi Danuda_U, Thank you for your quick reply.  My computer is a late 2011 MacBook Air operating system 10.7 Lion when I bought it and with all the updates since.  I installed skype at the same time with all the consequent updates since.  After I posted my message, my Mozilla Firefox crashed, and then the Finder on the MacBook and has crashed for every attempt since to open them. My desktop no longer shows the documents I had on it with no bar or search possibility.  So I cannot take a screen shot of the profile to account attempt process. I have tried to log in to skype from my phone with the new password and the same loop occurs. There was no message before I was unceremoniously logged out of Skype. I was in the middle of writing an IM message.  I am taking my commuter to be checked for a virus or other fault.  Has my account been suspended because of the repeated log in attempts? How can I get it activated again and at least use on my phone? Is there a direct intervention I need to do on the computer Many thanks for your advise On Fri, 8 Sep 2017 at 16:48, Microsoft Community <*** Email address is removed for privacy ***> wrote: YOUR PROFILE | FAQ  Hello Jeremiah23,   Your question on Microsoft Community has received a reply from Danida_UMargaret.

"I've run into an interesting problem with a Windows 8.1 machine that recently crashed during a routine Windows Update cycle. System crashed on restart, and all you get is the blinking cursor screen as if no bootable drive is present. I can boot into repair disk to see the Windows 8.1 installation, but it now shows that Windows is on drive G: and C: has been changed to the system reserved partition. I've tried every combination of fixing MBR via command line and even rebuildbcd. I'm thinking Windows isn't corrupted at all, and my only issue is the boot loader being incorrect. If you look at BCDEdit you can see that the active partition on Boot Manager thinks that it still should be C:, but Windows Boot Loader shows the OS installed on drive G: How can I revert back to having the install partition back on drive C: like normal?

"Did you set the hard disk mode to IDE?  In order to install Windows XP on the partition you created, you will need to boot into your BIOS and set the hard disk mode to IDE. -------------------------------------------- After you have set the hard disk IDE mode, you can proceed to install Windows XP on the partition you created; Insert your Windows XP CD, then restart your computer. When prompted to boot from the CD, do so. This requires pressing any key on your keyboard. Windows XP will go through its setup process. Once you arrive at the Welcome Setup, press Enter on your keyboard to begin the setup process Press F8 on your keyboard to accept the license agreement Select the partition Select Format the partition using the NTFS file system Press F on your keyboard to begin the formatting. Installation files will now be copied to your hard disk Your system will be restarted, Windows XP setup will continue ---------------------------------------------- After Windows XP installs successfully, you will not be able to boot into Windows 7. This is where the recovery disc for Windows 7 comes in. 1. Put the Windows 7 Recovery disc installation disc into the disc drive, and then start the computer. 2. Press a key when the message indicating ""Press any key to boot from CD or DVD …"". appears. 3. Select a language, a time, a currency, and a keyboard or another input method, and then click Next. 4. Click Repair your computer. 5. Click the operating system that you want to repair, and then click Next. 6. In the System Recovery Options dialog box, click Command Prompt. 7. Type sfc /scannow, and then press ENTER. -------------------------------------------- After you have repaired your Windows 7 installation and try to boot it, you will notice that Windows 7 does not boot. Boot into the BIOS again and set the hard disk mode to SATA. You will now be able to boot into Windows 7 again. ------------------------------------------- After doing that, download EasyBCD and add a boot entry for Windows XP to the Windows 7 boot manager; EasyBCD by NeoSmart Technologies would be your answer, it provides a graphical front end to the BCDEdit Command line that makes it easy for you to define start-up settings and edit boot entries on the new Windowsboot manager. http://neosmart.net/dl.php?id=1 ------------------------------------------ The next step now is make it possible for Windows 7 to boot in IDE mode. Here are the instructions for doing that: http://www.vistax64.com/general-discussion/271218-switch-ahci-ide-tutorial-howto.html Welcome all , so let me explain I installed Windows 7 With AHCI set from Bios , but after that i wanted to use ide (becose it boots faster) and when i set Ide from Bios , the windows 7 loading screan camed upp and BSOD (Blue screen of death) with an error code 0x0000005B , i tryed the regedit trick by setting in the ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESystemCurrentControlSetServicesMsahci"" and then in the right pan the START value from 0 i set it to 1 and it supposed to be working but it was a failiure , it still did the Bsod and i was so pissed of , i wanted to make it work ... AND I DID IT !  Here are the pases : 1) I assume u have installed Windows Vista or Windows 7 with AHCI set from BIOS ! 2) Download my registry fix (to add the ide keys to regeditor) simply apply the key 3) Now the manually regedit part Go to :  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE_System_CurrentControlSet_Services_Msahci HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE_System_CurrentControlSet_Services_iaStor HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE_System_CurrentControlSet_Services_iaStorV  And in thease three keys in the right pan u will find a key named ""START"" change at all three (Msahci,iaStor,iaStorV) values from 0 To 1 Now navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE_System_CurrentControlSet_Services_PciIde ,then change the start value to ""0""    4) Now u are allmost done , restart your computer/laptop , and go to Bios and set from AHCI to IDE !!! , save settings in Bios and restart  5)Windows will be loading , and VOILA !!! NO BSOD !!! , windows Vista/Seven will install new Ide drivers and u will see in windows device manager that you dont have AHCI drivers anymore , u have Ide drivers ! 6)It will prompt for another restart , just restart it and u will be happy ---------------------------------  The first option I would recommend, if you really need to run Windows XP is to use Windows Virtual PC with Windows XP Mode, you will need to upgrade to Windows 7 Professional or Ultimate in order to gain access to Windows XP Mode. Windows 7 - Anytime Upgrade - Frequently Asked Questions: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Windows-Anytime-Upgrade-frequently-asked-questions Windows 7 - Anytime Upgrade features: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/products/features/windows-anytime-upgrade ----------- or, if you have a full retail version of Windows XP Professional or XP Home, you can download the free Windows Virtual PC and use your own license; http://techingiteasy.wordpress.com/2012/05/02/how-to-use-virtualization-softwarewindows-virtual-pc/ The other option, if you already have a Windows XP license, is to dual boot with Windows 7: The following instructions will show how to dual boot Windows 7 and XP on your machine instead of replacing one with the other.

"Hi,  Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.  Yes, Bing allows direct linking and you link directly to the sales page from the Bing ad. Here are the steps to start a direct linking campaign on Bing:  1: Setup your first campaign  First, open a Bing or Microsoft account. Then you can create your first campaign. Click on the “Campaigns” tab and select “Create campaign”. Then, name your campaign and set up the budget.  2: Create your ad  Next, you need to actually write your ad. Make sure you research your product well and pick the most appropriate keywords for your target market. When you’re done, enter the ad title, ad text, the Display URL and the Destination URL.  Here’s the difference between Display URL and Destination URL?   The Display URL is where you can add your main keyword to increase the click-through-rate and improve your results. Remember, although the Display and Destination URL are used for different purpose, the domain name of the Display URL and Destination URL should always be the same. If you’re using more than one word in the Display URL, you can separate those either by an underscore or by hyphens.  3: Add your affiliate link  Now it’s time to add your affiliate link in the Destination URL box.

Tried Total Commander but never got used to the layout.  Seemed awkward.  Maybe because they opted to do things a little differently from Windows Explorer.

"You can easily tell what I mean by adding a manual bookmark to a text paragraph and enable the option (in File | Options | Advanced) to show bookmarks:  [Bookmarked text.]  The brackets illustrate that the whole paragraph is bookmarked.  Now, if you click at the very beginning of the paragraph and type something, or press Enter, you'll notice that the bookmark expands to include the new content:  [ Bookmarked text.]  In other words, the bookmarked text now includes a paragraph mark. In fact, anything that you add at the beginning of a bookmarked paragraph will be added inside the bookmark. This will cause trouble when you update a cross-reference that makes use of the bookmark.  When you let Word create hidden bookmarks (and it always does when you make use of the Cross-reference function), the situation is even more tricky.

"Hi Meg,  Please check the following methods and see if there is any improvement:  Method 1: Check the hard disc name Make sure that your hard disc has a name. The name cannot be all numbers but can contain numbers. The name must start with a letter. It must not contain any special characters, such as periods, commas, semi-colons, quotation marks, and so on.   Method 2: Save to a different location e.g. the desktop   Method 3: Empty the AutoRecovery folder (make sure you have quit all Office applications) 1. Paste defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES in Terminal (Finder > Applications > Utilities > Terminal), and then press return to show hidden files. 2. Hold the ‘Option/alt’ key, right click on the Finder icon in the dock and click Relaunch. 3.

Method 5: Press and hold the Shift key to start or restart your Mac in safe mode to determine whether other background applications and add-ins are interfering with Word.   If the issue still occurs, please provide the following information: 1. Can you open Word application? If Yes, when you create a new document, does the issue occur? Does the issue occur to all the existing documents? What are their common features (file format e.g. .doc, the application version that created the documents and so on)? 2. What actions have you performed before the issue occurred for the first time? For example, a system update and a software installation. Does the issue occur right after the upgrade? 3. Detailed steps and related screenshots (error messages) about how you encounter the issue. Do you double click to open documents?  4. Your Mac OS version (e.g. 10.12.4) and Word version. For Mac OS version, from the Apple menu, choose About This Mac.

" I am sorry to hear that you are having issue with your Skype application for Windows 10. I will help you on that.  You, and the person you're calling should follow these steps: 1. Use the latest version of Skype. We're always improving call quality, so for best performance, make sure that you and the person you're calling are using the latest version of Skype. Download the latest version. 2. Check your connection. If your audio or video calls freeze, your video looks block-like or has motion blur, it might be your internet connection (or your friend's) causing the problem. If Skype detects a weak connection, it will reduce the quality to try and stop the call from dropping altogether. 3. Is another application interfering with your call? Close any applications that could be interfering with your call. File sharing applications, streaming audio or video, or even just having a web browser open are all things that can eat up bandwidth.

"Hi Rhonda lourenço frança cabral machado and welcome to the Skype Community!   It is possible that the account logged in to the Skype application and on Skype for Web are two different accounts. Contacts are saved on Skype's servers, you can access them by logging in to your account across all supported platforms and devices.  Skype accounts were migrated to Microsoft October last year, although users with legacy accounts (Skype Name-created accounts) still need to fully update their accounts to enjoy the benefits of a Microsoft account.   One of the perks of having an updated account is that, you can sign in across Microsoft services and products by using either your Skype Name or your email address. You might have signed in to Skype using the associated email address of your account without fully updating it yet, which resulted in a newly created Skype account.   If you want to know if you have multiple accounts, please go to this link and enter the email address and then click Continue. After doing this, you'll be able to see all the active Skype accounts associated with your email address.  Remember to always sign in using the credentials you used to originally create the account. Check the Skype Name logged in to the application and make sure to sign in on Skype for Web using the same credentials.   Let us know what happens after.    Thanks.

"Dell 5110 AMD version with W7 64 bit. This laptop works real crisp when it is not frozen. It is getting random total freezes that don’t seem to be caused by any specific task. It freezes whatever is on the screen, the mouse and keyboard. All that is left is the power button and the led’s. It may happen as soon as windows starts, after a couple hours of use or anywhere in between. Usually it seems to be pretty sudden and rarely gives any warning something is coming up. I have tried many of the things I have found to try and fix this.  Memtest and the Dell hardware tests all pass. The only added program on to what the OS has is chrome. I updated IE. Nothing has been done to likely get any malware but I have run Malwarebytes and superantispyware scans and they are clean. MSE scan comes out clean also. I have all current updates. Drivers are at a minimum and are all fine as far as what device manager says. I have run sfc scan and it always comes up clean. Seatools, Easeus surface test and chkdsk have been run, and all is fine. I have run defrag. When I watch task manager it is not running up the cpu or memory, those stay normal even when it freezes. Temps are not running up either.  This is the second clean install and both ended up with this same problem. Have done additional hd and memory tests and all pass. A video stress test was run and that was all fine. No way known to force bsod to get a memory dump as everything but the start button freezes when this happens. I tried a clean boot and it still freezes. I have had it in safe mode many times, including being on hours like that and no freezes ever. With that and the way it does very little if anything as a warning, no strange video or anything it seems to me this is probably not hardware, it seems to be some OS process?

"Somehow I have solved it. This problem only appeared after updating Office recently.   I went to the properties of a file saved as .ppsx which would open in power point in the edit mode instead of opening as a slide show. In the properties I went to Change how it opens then clicked on Power Point and clicked apply and OK. I saw that the icon had changed slightly and saw that the icons of all my .ppsx files had slightly changed and all the .ppsx files now open as a slide show and no longer in PP as an edit file.   Don’t know what happened but think that when you work in Power Point and save the file as a.ppsx it really does not save it as a.ppsx but as a .pptx (as it says it must in the Options in the PP program!!) by changing how it opens afterwards it has magically adopted the.ppsx and changed all the files with that suffix to open as shows!  Think it bypasses the glitch in the actual programme where it states in Options – Save that it must save as a presentation with no alternative such as a show.  In Power Point click on File then on Options and then on Save . There it says ""save files in this format"" there are four or five options but all are Presentations and there is no option to select anything else. Although when you select Power Point Show when you save the file it subliminaly saves it as a Presentation as the Options lays down.

"There were a couple of typos in my previous reply - now corrected I hope.  I've posted a couple of sample Word documents at https://goo.gl/YRNUkC to show how to do this.

"Hi,  This is too easy and I'm hear to show you how!  In the Recipe Name field in the Recipe Content tab, ensure the title of the recipe appears with no markings.  If the recipe is for Galactical Summer Squash, then this should say exactly that and only that in the formula bar when you click on the recipe name in the content tab.

Choose the second one that says to recalculate the box.  It won't say exactly that but it's the only option with the word recalculate on it.  Now click Click To View and all should be fine.

"I have a series of PowerPoint presentations that are essentially troubleshooting guides with shapes that link to work instructions, videos, etc. that are contained in other slides.  They are on the larger side (between 50 and 200MB) and have a few hundred slides each. The presentations are stored in a OneDrive for Business folder.  When I try to view them using PowerPoint Online, the pages load very slowly when I click on a link, and occasionally the program times out and crashes.

I created two test presentations, one with 100 slides and one with 5.

"You do sync to Healthvault You could share info through Healthvault consider carefully which people should be allowed to see the information. What options do I have for sharing health information?   There are several ways in HealthVault to share health  information:   Give another HealthVault user online access to part or all of a HealthVault record: You can give people who have HealthVault accounts access to some or all of the  information in a HealthVault record. You can specify either read-only access or permission to modify the record. You can also specify which types of health  information to  share and not  share. Learn how to share a record. Create an emergency profile: An emergency profile contains key medical  information that others can view in an emergency. You can print wallet cards or page-sized sheets containing your emergency profile information. You can also create access codes that give online access to your emergency profile, which might be more up-to-date than a printout. Learn more about creating an emergency profile. Print information from your record and show the printout to your doctor or other person. Learn more about printing health information. Use encrypted messaging: To protect the privacy of medical-related email with your doctors, use the Message Center app (US accounts only). This app uses encryption to reduce the chance of unauthorized access to sensitive health  information that you exchange with your doctors.  Learn more about Message Center. How do I give access to a HealthVault record to another trusted person?   To share your health record with someone you trust:   Sign in to HealthVault. On the left side of the page, click Sharing. Click Share health information with someone you trust. Complete the form, then click Send invitation.  A few things to note:   You choose the level of access you allow. You can let someone view and use but not change  information, view and change  information, or act as a custodian of the record. People you share with can authorize apps to have the same kind of access they do. For example, someone who can only view  information can allow an app to view the  information, but not to change it. You also decide what types of information you want to  share. You can select specific  information types, or you can  share everything in your record. If you give access only to selected items, you’ll need to send a new sharing invitation if you later decide to  share additional  information types. To provide an extra level of security for the invitation, set a passcode. Don't forget to tell the recipient the passcode! You can set a new one if you resend the invitation. You can set an expiration date on the recipient's access. In addition, HealthVault sets an expiration date on the invitation; if the invitation is not accepted within the expiration period, you will need to resend it. To accept the invitation, the person you invite to access the record must have a HealthVault account. If they do not have one, they will be invited to sign up for HealthVault.  Note   For performance reasons, Windows Phone allows only one location tracking app to remain active at any given time. If you need to use an app that requires access to your location while the Bing Health & Fitness app is tracking your workout (even a non-fitness app, such as Facebook or Bing search), we recommend that you launch the Bing Health & Fitness app again after you're done so the app remains active and continues to track your workout.   https://account.healthvault.com/help/en-US/default.htm    Hope this helps.",4,0.3661173982957809,0.9834238317977106,True,True,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,4,1.0,2591,175,154,False,False,True,False,0.022,0.85,0.128,0.9953

"Hi DJ: My name is Ron. Yes, having too many unused styles in the document complicates it. And can lead to document corruption. I have several documents I collect info from the web into. They are constantly adding unused styles that I clean up. Actually, it is a 2 step process. First delete unused styles, then I go through remaining ""extra"" styles and apply my standard styles before deleting the now unused style. Here are some macros you can play with to find one that works best for you: DETERMINING HOW MANY STYLES ARE AVAILABLE http://word.tips.net/T000803_Determining_How_Many_Styles_are_Available.html Summary: Got a macro that processes or uses styles? You definitely need to know how many styles Word has available in the document. Use the Count property of the Styles collection to determine the figure. FINDING UNUSED STYLES http://word.tips.net/T001488_Finding_Unused_Styles.html Summary: Use this VBA macro to determine which styles are being used in the current Word document. REMOVING UNUSED STYLES http://word.tips.net/T001337_Removing_Unused_Styles.html Summary: Got an older document that has a bunch of unused styles defined in it? You can get rid of those styles easily by using the short macro in this tip DELETE UNUSED STYLES (TAKE 2) http://word.mvps.org/faqs/numbering/RemoveManualNumbers.htm This macro below and at this site is excellent but I notice it does not exactly remove all manually Outlined Numbered paragraphs which have been converted to Normal or Plain text - Like any ""Article"" heading or even A., B., numbering for certain paragraphs. However, it does remove 1.1, (a), etc. numbering which I find odd. DELETE UNUSED STYLES (TIP) The use of Style.Delete is not the best way to go. If multiple styles are deleted by the loop the time taken blows out exponentially and will typically be 30 minutes to delete 100 styles. Instead use: Application.OrganizerDelete Source:= ActiveDocument.Path & ""\"" & ActiveDocument.Name, _ Name:=oStyle.NameLocal, Object:=wdOrganizerObjectStyles It will then take only a few seconds to delete 100 or more styles. I have a few more (long) macros that don't have links if the above ones don't do it for you. Bonus: STYLE REPORT ADD-IN http://gregmaxey.mvps.org/word_tip_pages/style_report_addin.html With Style Report, users can quickly loop through the style collection and with the user interface provided make a decision to keep or delete the styles used in a document or previously used styles that are not applied to any text.

"Hi Daisy, Welcome to Microsoft Answers!  In addition to Coork's post, you  may follow  these steps. Check if the issue persists in Safe Mode. Method 1: Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs do not run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start Windows are installed. Safe mode is useful for troubleshooting problems with programs and drivers that might not start correctly, or that might prevent Windows from starting correctly. If a problem does not reappear when you start in safe mode, you can eliminate the default settings and basic device drivers as possible causes. If a recently installed program, device, or driver prevents Windows from running correctly, you can start your computer in safe mode and then remove the program that is causing the problem. 1. Restart your computer. Click the Start button, click the arrow next to the Lock button, and then click Restart. 2. Do one of the following: ·  If your computer has a single operating system installed, press and hold the F8 key as your computer restarts. You need to press F8 before the Windows logo appears. If the Windows logo appears, you will need to try again by waiting until the Windows logon prompt appears, and then shutting down and restarting your computer. ·  If your computer has more than one operating system, use the arrow keys to highlight the operating system you want to start in safe mode, and then press F8. 3. On the Advanced Boot Options screen, use the arrow keys to highlight the safe mode option you want, and then press ENTER. Log on to your computer with a user account that has administrator rights. When your computer is in safe mode, you'll see the words Safe Mode in the corners of the display. To exit safe mode, restart your computer and let Windows start normally. If the issue does not occur in Safe mode, perform a clean boot. Method 2: Follow these steps to perform a Clean Boot. Note If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps. We strongly recommend that you do not use the System Configuration utility to modify the advanced boot options on the computer unless a Microsoft support engineer directs you to do this. Doing this may make the computer unusable. a. Log on to the computer by using an account that has administrator rights. b. Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility.If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue. c. On the General tab, click Selective Startup, and then click to clear the Load startup items check box. (The Use Original Boot.ini check box is unavailable.) d. On the Services tab, click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box, and then click Disable all. Note: Following this step lets Microsoft services continue to run. These services include Networking, Plug and Play, Event Logging, Error Reporting, and other services. If you disable these services, you may permanently delete all restore points. Do not do this if you want to use the System Restore utility together with existing restore points. e. Click OK, and then click Restart. Note: Reset the computer to start as usual After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual: a. Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue. b. On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK. c. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.

I have been away for a few months.  When I restarted my computer upon my return home, I received a message on the screen to update windows.  I went through the up date process (which was quite long) When I tried to print a message which came as a PDF file the printer acted like it would print but only a blank sheet came out.  I went through the trouble shooting steps from EPSON and the printer seemed to be OK.  I tried printing a word document which I had in a file and the same result.  I went through all the trouble shooting steps listed, but no change.  At that time I could print the Test Page.    Today after receiving your reply I uninstalled the printer and reinstalled it.  Now it will not even print the test page.  I can’t help but think this all has to do with the upgrade to windows 10.

"Hello, I have found Windows 10 on my new laptop (an ultra-thin HP x360 - 13.3"") rather confusing. I understand there's a ""way"" to get back to the days of Windows 7 backup, whereby the Windows image is also created onto the backup medium so it can be used in the future for recovery if need be. But I am also told (and gather from the many confusing blogs out there), that Windows 10 is just to keep File History -- i.e., backup and maintain versions of a file.  The Windows OS image itself doesn't seem to be covered by the Windows 10 File History/Backup. One suggestion I got was to use Macrium Reflect (free version) to keep the Windows 10 image for recovery purposes.  And then separately, use Windows 10 File History/Backup for my own privately-created files and folders.  This sounds interesting but implies (I think) keeping two distinct and separate backups:  one for Windows OS image and one for my important files.

"  As mentioned in the OP I'm on a desktop PC (Win OS on SSD, i7 4790, R9 390, 32 GB DDR3). This is a very capable gaming rig, and easily exceeds the sys requirements. No. I never tried previously to launch the Game Bar. This is the first time I've tried and I haven't been able to get it to launch.   Changes to Windows 10? None other than the usual updates  I just tried this now. I was able to uninstall and reinstall the Xbox app. When I went to try and launch the Game Bar it flashed on the screen for about a second and then was gone. Only way to get it back was to again uninstall and reinstall the Xbox App. I was able to then launch the Game Bar and this time it stayed open. But if I then go to launch the game it disappears. I've discovered that if I toggle the slider from Off to On in Settings > Gaming >Game Bar i can get it back but it's acting really weird.  Accessing the Game bar menu locks up the screen and I have to restart Explorer to get everything back.   So I've got it to show but I'm still completely unsuccessful actually getting it to now work with a game. If I have to toggle the slider in  Settings > Gaming >Game Bar to get it to work, then the game minimizes. Then when I click to relaunch the game neither Win + G or Ctrl + Shift + G works to launch game Bar because the Settings menu is then not the active window. So I'm stuck in that fail loop. Clicking the game maximizes the game, but no Game bar .... Clicking Settings to toggle the slider allows me to show the Game Bar but the game isn't maximized to allow the Game Bar to recognize it .... I click the Game bar menu settings and it then locks up the screen .... so there's no way to activate both at the same time - I either have an active Game Bar and no game, or an active Game and no Game Bar.   So it actually shows up now but is definitely not working properly      ",7,0.6540347590397593,0.9062920605249752,True,True,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,7,0.7777777777777778,1256,115,104,True,False,False,False,0.095,0.865,0.041,-0.9692

Hi absurd. You make a new app with less functionality  than the old one. Then you tell people to use their desktop.  no. Actually I want to use my mobile with the app as it was able to send sms.  And of course it's possible to republish the old software of the a app as it was.  Stop pulling my leg.  Your new app is USELESS. How many people does it take to tell you that before you get the message?  How many one star reviews on Google play does it take before you get the message.   You are behind a Avington as an arrogant gravy train bureaucracy rather than a commercial organisation that cares about its customers.  I pay subscription to Skype and use it. And if I don't use it you don't get paid.   Clearly the numpties at Skype on the gravy-train payroll think they will continue to be paid whatever they do.  Not from me if I can't use the service that I need.

"Skype for 'Windows Desk Top' and 'Windows 10' Since sometime now, I call a person in my skype contacts, but as soon as my spokesperson picks up the call, Skype hangs up, and I get the message """"The content of this message is unsupported"" "". Same issue if my contact tries to calls me. I checked out problem on internet and read that there could be several reasons for the call failing. It could be a problem with your microphone or speakers, or the camera device. One could try calling echo123 to make sure that your devices work fine. It could also be a problem with the remote party your calling. Maybe they're using an older version of Skype that is no longer supported.  Well I tried all the remedies proposed however with regret I report that the problem persists.In sequence a.) I uninstalled skype, restarted my laptop and installed skype traditional version from link provided in skype support. Problem remained. b.) I uninstalled the traditional version previously installed and installed the version for windows 10, since la[top runs on windows 10. Problem remained. c.) I also tried to update the device drivers on my laptop and restarted pc with pc running both versions of skype. Once again problem remained. d.) Called echo123 as suggested above to make sure that my devices worked fine ... and confirmed that all was ok. Skype is my life line to my partner and we are find it hard to accept that we did not have this problem up to a couple of weeks ago ... and we are more perturbed that we are unable to find a solution to the problem.

"I'm about to pull my hair out. To make matters worse, Skype's ""Customer Support"" is an endless loop of ""Getting in touch with someone"" through means of a virtual person that redirects you to a contact page that redirects you to the virtual customer service page again. I'm REALLY STARTING TO GET ANNOYED. ANYWAY, the problem I'm having has existed for ages for me. Every time, and I do mean EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I open the skype app on my phone, it resets my Desktop Skype status to ""Available"" from ""Do not Disturb"". To make matters worse, I have found no conceivable way to stop this from happening. Turning off all notifications on skype mobile does nothing. There is also not visible way to change skype statues on mobile. As a result, every time I try to use it, it sets me to Available on Desktop and all notifications start playing through all three linked devices I have (Desktop, Laptop, and Mobile). To Clarify: I recently got a brand new phone and am running the latest version of the skype mobile app. Please note: IF YOUR SOLUTION IS TO ROLL BACK THE VERSION, I might as well just uninstall it at that point. IT TAKES LESS EFFORT TO UNINSTALL SKYPE THAN IT DOES TO ROLL IT BACK. I literally just want to stay Do Not Disturb. I am always DND on Skype, and I do not want to be set to available. Another ""Solution"" That isn't a solution is muting every chat individually. That is a lot of effort to go through for something that should be a SIMPLE FREAKING FIX! Not to mention, it defeats the entire purpose. Please, for the love of GOD, solve my problem.

"Hello Edgar Banks,     Welcome to the Skype Community forum! I do understand the inconvenience you have faced.   To resolve audio issues on Skype calls, you and the person you’re calling should follow the steps below:   1. Use the latest version of Skype. We're always improving call quality, so for best performance, make sure that you and the person you're calling are using the latest version of Skype. Download the latest version.   2. Check your connection. If your audio or video calls freeze, your video looks block-like or has motion blur, it might be your internet connection (or your friend's) causing the problem. If Skype detects a weak connection, it will reduce the quality to try and stop the call from dropping altogether.   • Using a computer? Plug your Ethernet cable directly into your modem or router. If you're using Wi-Fi, try moving closer to the router. If you're not connected, the Windows 10 guide Why can't I get online? will give you tips to fix any connection issues.   • Using a mobile device? Use a speed test app to check the performance of your mobile connection, and check the result against the download and upload speeds required for Skype.   3. Is another application interfering with your call? Close any applications that could be interfering with your call. File sharing applications, streaming audio or video, or even just having a web browser open are all things that can eat up bandwidth.   To troubleshoot problems with Skype calls, please refer to this link: Troubleshooting problems with Skype calls   I hope this helps.

I have  posted for over 4 years about the many problems I have had and still have with Microsoft.  Keep It Simple Stupid. That works.  Since 8-13-17 Posts about "" Vertical Panel"" have increased from about 9,000 to about 19,000 that do not like the ""Innovative"" ""new ""Vertical Panel"". I have no clue about ""Vertical Panel""?

"Hi Skype, My iPhone automatically updated my (wonderful) old version 6.1.210 of Skype to the new (terrible) Skype. 30 minutes of wasted effort trying to work out how to use it I gave up and used my OS X desktop app. Luckily I had not updated my itunes app library so deleted the new version of Skype and reloaded the one I loved best back onto my phone. That's when my login in problems started. I have reset my password on the phone and have been able to log in using my MacBook Pro with it but it refuses to let me log in with my iPhone. When resetting the password via the phone it told me I needed to set up a Microsoft account which I did not want but did it anyway in the vague hope that it would let me log in. Sadly that did not work either. So at present my phone says ""unable to connect to skype"" and the only place I can log into Skype is via my desktop. So to recap:- Things I have tried but have not worked. I have checked my iPhone, computer and router network settings and can surf the web on my iPhone via wifi or 4G. I have reset the Skype password and created a Microsoft account but that does not help logging in on the phone. I have turned off the phone and on again. Went through the phone recover details process whereby it tells me I have one skype account but refuses to let me Sign in. Things I will not do. Use the new iOS version of Skype. Continue to have a Microsoft account as I don't want it or need it.

I am still not sure if it will work in the long run, because some other people also managed to make the WiFi controller work temporarily, but it would disconnect again after short time.

It's pretty clear though that my pages are still indexed and when a Bing user enters a search term that includes a page from my site as a result it is then stripped out before showing it. It's as if there is a filter just before displaying the results that my pages get edited out. Clearly Bing has an issue with the site but... I'm also sure that for some reason my site triggered an automated scan that now needs to be manually reset for my site to show again. Any thoughts?

"Hi Jrahn,  Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.  I can imagine the inconvenience you are experiencing and will certainly help you in the right direction to fix the issue. However, I would appreciate if you could answer a few questions to narrow down the issue in order to provide you with better assistance.   Let’s try these methods below and check if that solves the problem.  Method 1: Try Hardware and devices troubleshooter   The hardware and devices troubleshooter can detect and fix errors and incorrect settings in devices. You can run the built in troubleshooter in Windows 8 and check by following these steps: a) Press Windows Key + X, select control panel b) Change the ‘view by’ option on the top right to ‘Larger icons’ c) Select the Troubleshooting option and click ‘view all’ on the left panel d) Run the ‘Hardware and devices ‘troubleshooter.   Method 2:  Let’s follow the steps in the article below and check if that helps in solving the problem.  Troubleshoot wired keyboards that don’t respond or that type wrong characters http://support.microsoft.com/kb/258826/en-us  Note: This article deals with Windows 7 but steps provided holds good for Windows 8.1 too.  Method 3:  If problem persists let’s check the issue by using OSK (On screen keyboard) and see if issue persists or not. If issue will not appear it means the issue is with keyboard.  Windows also has the On-Screen Keyboard (OSK), an Ease of Access tool. Use the OSK instead of a physical keyboard to move around your PC and enter text. You don’t need a touchscreen to use the OSK. The OSK displays a visual keyboard with all the standard keys. Select keys using the mouse or another pointing device, or use a physical single key or group of keys to cycle through the keys on the screen.  Use the On-Screen Keyboard (OSK) to type  Hope this would help.

"I use iOS on an Iphone 6s and have received no calls since updating my mobile version of skype. The main problem is that I no longer receive notification for calls to my skype number on my device, even when my statuses (both PC and mobile) are shown as online.  I used to set myself to Do Not Disturb and would still receive calls, now I do not receive any calls to my skype number via mobile.

Unfortunately the problem is not with teams (I have Liverpool and Greenock Morton pinned but neither of those has much chance of appearing in a world cup finals tournament).

"As a Word for Mac 2016 user I recently upgraded to the new High Sierra OS. Unfortunately it is raising havoc with my fonts.  Here is the problem. As a writer I have used Times New Roman as my default font for years. I have always used it with curly quotes as that is what my editors prefer. Recently, a strange thing has been happening with Times New Roman curly quotes and some other punctuation marks. Instead of producing them in Times, the document automatically changes the quotation mark font to Helvetica. That then changes the following text to Helvetica as well. If I turn off curly quotes and use only straight quotes the problem goes away. As an experiment I tried using other serif fonts with curly quotes. They also automatically convert to Helvetica. With one exception: Garamond.  This quotation mark issue raised havoc with my 700 page book manuscript, causing me to have to go through it line by line to fix the quotes. Search and replace does not really help since when it adds Helvetica it converts blocks of text after that. Right now as I stare at a deadline, my only option is to convert the entire manuscript to Garamond and forget any idea of ever using Times again. That is not an acceptable solution. S0...How do I get Times New Roman to work WITH curly quotes?  I have wasted too many hours trying to find a solution to this and have found nothing.

Is there any resources I can look at to guide me. Many thanks Ashley.,1,1.0,0.7843725731766659,True,False,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0.25,273,36,36,True,True,False,False,0.0,0.86,0.14,0.8807

"Dear April,  Many thanks for your quick replies, and for your interest in helping to identify the problem.  I tried booting in safe mode, and then started up each helper app that typically runs in the background, one by one, to see if I could find any culprits.   Good news! I identified that whenever Moom (the OS X window management software developed by Many Tricks) was running in the background, this PowerPoint crashing issue when switching between Normal and Notes Page views would occur. When I quit Moom and attempt the same steps in PowerPoint, the problem does not occur. I'm never had issues with PowerPoint and Moom like this before, but apparently something has changed during their upgrade cycles, causing a dependency on common processes (?) to fail.   It seems strange to me that a window management app with apparently no dependencies on PowerPoint would cause issues like this when the PowerPoint view is changed, but quitting Moom does solve the problem on all of my machines, two running El Capitan (10.11.6) and one running Sierra.  I suppose the next step is to report this to Many Tricks... but I also wonder if this is not a PowerPoint issue as well.  At any rate, thanks very much for helping me to track down the problematic process. Safe boot mode and a little sleuthing did the trick! Now I need to find an alternative for Moom that won't interfere with PowerPoint...

Like the title says. I am looking for a way to sync my Bing maps favorites from My desktop pc to my laptop. My wife and I are planning a trip to Ireland and we are setting up the places we want to go through the bing maps app installed with Win 8.1. I'd rather use my desktop to do this because I have a 32 inch screen and this makes it much easier to view and setup points on the map. Obviously I won't be taking my desktop and 32 inch screen to Ireland with me (although it would be nice lol) I will be taking my 11 inch laptop with me as it is much more portable. But I can't for the life of my figure out how to sync them without syncing the entire computer.

"Hi Stephen,  Were there any changes made on the computer prior to the issue?  The common two causes of this issue can be: a. Microsoft Account has not been verified yet on your computer. b. Date and time in your computer is set wrongly.  Method 1: The store app uses https instead of http which is used by other apps, so in order for the SSL handshake to proceed, the clock on the client and server needs to be correct. Follow the steps below to check if the date and time are set correctly. a) In the Start screen type “Date and Time”, and click on Date and time settings. b) Check if the date and time is set correctly.  Method 2: Follow the steps below to finish 2 step verification process (Important) a. Close the Store app completely (swipe down from the top). b. Open the charms bar, click on Settings and then on “Change PC settings”. c. Click on Accounts, It will show your Microsoft account there.  d. See if there is a “verify” link below your account.  If so, click on it and go through the 2 step verification process e. Once done try starting the store and check if you are able to visit Windows Store.
