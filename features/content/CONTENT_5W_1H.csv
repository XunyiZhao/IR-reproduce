I use a Huawei E153 3G modem on a regular basis and it one day refused to connect, stating that ""After starting, the service hung in a start-pending state."" After some searching, I discovered that this was the RASMAN service not starting up. I tried going to my network connections to change the IP of my ethernet port, but the Network and Sharing page just froze and after a very long time (5-10 minutes) the settings window loads, only to wait just as long before I can go to the adapter settings screen.

"We appreciate your response. Your concern about connectivity issues can be due to software conflicts related to the specified program that you're using. The specified application installs USB drivers and lists a number of items to consider when using USB as your preferred private branch exchange (PBX) setting.

In the clean boot environment, check if you'll still experience connectivity issues when using the application along with the 3G dongle.

Do you already have an Operating system installed in Legacy mode? If so switching to EUFI mode will stop the OS from booting.

"Hello, I have found Windows 10 on my new laptop (an ultra-thin HP x360 - 13.3"") rather confusing. I understand there's a ""way"" to get back to the days of Windows 7 backup, whereby the Windows image is also created onto the backup medium so it can be used in the future for recovery if need be. But I am also told (and gather from the many confusing blogs out there), that Windows 10 is just to keep File History -- i.e., backup and maintain versions of a file.  The Windows OS image itself doesn't seem to be covered by the Windows 10 File History/Backup. One suggestion I got was to use Macrium Reflect (free version) to keep the Windows 10 image for recovery purposes.  And then separately, use Windows 10 File History/Backup for my own privately-created files and folders.  This sounds interesting but implies (I think) keeping two distinct and separate backups:  one for Windows OS image and one for my important files. Any advice, tips, or suggestions on a proper approach would be highly appreciated. Thank you in advance.","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Yes I recommend the 2 separate backups approach. A full Image copy backup, either using the Win 7 backup or Macrium. This is to primarily capture your OS, but it can also capture your personal data files. Personally I prefer Macrium so that I can create a bootable USB/DVD disk to run the restore from, just in case of a ""worst case"" problem. Yes, File History is only intended for your ""personal"" data files. It requires an external drive, like a SD card or USB drive. File history is 'automatic' and constant, while Win7/Macrium is a long interval manual process. Unfortunately for me File History is not working. For some reason is it not recognizing the option for it to automatically delete files when space is needed, so it keeps whining about no space on my backup drive. There is a 3rd option. That is to use OneDrive. It will automatically backup your defined folders to the cloud. That is if you don't mind sharing your personal files with the cloud.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]"

"Hello Virginia,  When a computer device will not boot to the Windows desktop screen, you can force activate the Advanced Startup Options menu (ASO) in the following manner.  Power up the device, wait for the Manufacturer's logo screen to appear, then immediately hard shut down (hold the power button down until the LED light shuts off) Repeat this process 2-3 times, until the ASO menu activates.  The ASO menu will offer a variety of recovery options you can try to get your device running again.  Regards, WayneAustin ","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Thank-you Austin,  That is what I did several times today. Also used Windows 10 repair disk from 2015. Originally got no boot disc found message. Got into startup and exited to defaults. HP logo came on once or twice then would put up no boot disc message. Did this most of the day.   Powered up at 11:21pm and it booted. Update history says the 9/29 installed last. Soon as desktop loaded message popped-up saying update could not install. Yesterday pop-up notification asked me to set a time for the restart as the installation time would be longer than usual. Did not schedule, did install and restart from power off button.   Is this from windows or have I been hacked?  Thank-you again for responding. E.G. Roland","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

BSOD error notes I've made: Driver overran stack buffer Kmode exception not handled Recource not owned Kernal security check failure Reference by pointer FLTMGR.sys CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED Bad pool caller NTFS.sys Page fault in nonpaged area DPC watchdog violation System thread exception not handled Safe mode is the only way to be able to use my system. The PC can't even remain stable for long enough to reinstall windows! Hardware-wise nothing  has been tweaked beyond how it came in the box. Here are my specs, in case it helps.Here is my report from System Information and here are my mini dumps . When this issue began Two days ago. These may or may not be related, but when playing PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) I got a system lock up accompanied by a plain screen of flat colour (which may actually be close to my theme's colour: dark red and an audio stutter/buzz). Hard power-down is required. As my best guess, this was the when the BSODs started. Recurring issue Yes. If I can get to Safe Mode is it fine though. I can't recall a BSOD in Safe Mode. Cause/Steps to recreate the issue Turn on PC and it'll happen almost instantly. Some BSODs happen before you even get into Windows. Crashes even happen during Windows install process. The only way to reinstall was to take the SSD out and install Windows using another PC before putting the SSD back into my box. Plugging something into USB will almost certainly BSOD it too. What I've tried so far to resolve the issue Win10's inbuilt memory test MemTest86 (8 passes) Tested RAM sticks individually chkdsk + scandisk Rebuild MBR System Restore (BSOD interrupted this) System Reset (can't do it sometimes, other times it BSODs) Startup Repair (BSOD during) Removed GPU and tried onboard GFX Removed all other components and tested successfully separately Updating all motherboard drivers and flashing BIOS Tested one other set of RAM on motherboard compatibility list and still got BSODs Ubuntu seemed to run fine off USB3 There may be more, sorry I've tried so much I've probably forgotten some. Everything seems to point to the motherboard being faulty but I've just got this gut feeling that because safe mode is stable it's not faulty. Before I send it off for RMA and potentially incur a cost for them not finding it faulty I thought I'd try one last time to find an expert who might be able to shine some light on this for me. Thank you in advance for any help you can give me.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1]"

"Earlier this year I started noticing that certain keys wouldn't always take. I would be typing and would realize that the shift key or space had not performed its function. But if I pressed deliberately and firmly, it would work. Over time it seemed to get worse, or perhaps I just noticed it more. The right shift key and space tend to be the worst, but 4 on the number row and sometimes numbers on the keypad also do not want to work. The problem is random and sporadic. Sometimes so bad I have difficulty even typing out a short message. Other times I can use the computer for days with minimal issue. The Toshiba troubleshooter and some online sources advise uninstalling the keyboard driver and restarting the computer. I have done this a number of times. Sometimes it seems like it may help for a little while, but the problem always comes back. I'm out of warranty, so they refuse to let me even talk to tech support without charging me. In the list of drivers for my computer, they do not have a keyboard driver. I've seen indications that some people have trouble with conflicts with a Lenovo/Synaptics driver. My touchpad is ELAN, not Synaptics, so that isn't it (although I did try uninstalling and reinstalling the touchpad driver anyway, just in case). I booted Ubuntu from a flash drive and had no problems with the keyboard. Again, with any test it's hard to be sure, given the random and sporadic nature of this issue, but it seems pretty sure that it's a software problems that only developed after the Windows 10 Creator Update. Based on other tips I found online, I have tried removing the battery and waiting for several minutes before starting the computer, and plugging in a USB keyboard, typing and removing the USB keyboard. The problem always comes back. It seems my next course of action may be to factory reset the computer and hope that fixes it--although not only is that a major hassle, but I wonder if, once the computer is restored and updates, the problem will not simply return. Does anyone know where I can find a Satellite S50-C keyboard driver? Toshiba has let me down and I can't seem to find anything. I've found a few Windows 7 drivers for older Toshiba laptops, but I need something explicitly designed to work on Windows 10... ideally something for my model of laptop. Or is there some other solution to this issue?","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
" Hi Chad,  If you’re having issues with your keyboard, it can be due to an incompatible driver or broken system components after installing the update.  Let’s isolate this concern by performing a clean boot. This troubleshooting technique will help us identify if there are applications that’s causing your keyboard not to work accordingly. Please click here for the instructions. Once you’re in the clean boot state, try to check the performance of your keyboard if the issue has been resolved.  Note: After the troubleshooting, refer to this section: “How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting” on the same support article to boot the computer in normal setup once the issue has been resolved.  If you’ll get the same result, try to install the latest Windows 10 Creators Update Build that may contain possible fixes and enhancements. Check this article to find out and install the latest Build.  Additionally, you can search and install the Satellite S50-C keyboard driver from the manufacturer’s website.   Let us know the result after performing the suggested steps.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

You can see this yourself by following the link you sent me. I have been unable to find any compatible Windows 10 keyboard driver. It's entirely possible that replacing the driver with a good driver would fix the problem--if I could find one.  Any other ideas?","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"As an additional step, you may reach out with the manufacturer of your computer to install any available BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) firmware. This may help resolving the issue with the performance of your keyboard.  In case that you already have the latest BIOS firmware on your device and the issue still persists, we suggest that you perform a clean install for Windows 10. This will ensure that your computer will be clean from possible software conflicts. Please click here for the steps.  Note: Make sure to back up your files so that you’ll be able to restore it afterwards. Also, you'll need to reinstall all the programs that you currently have once you’re done with the clean install.   Let us know the result after performing the suggested steps above.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Then, just a few days ago, there was a Windows 10 Update available--I had already checked for updates several times last week, so this was only published very recently, after I had started this thread. I installed that... and it seems ok! So far I haven't had any keyboard issues. I'm worried that it may come back (again, the problem occurred randomly) but after trying it for a couple days I think and hope the computer is fixed now. Yay! Perhaps this latest Windows 10 update did the trick. Or maybe I needed the combination of a BIOS update and a Windows update, who knows?

Before I hose my new computer, I need to know 2 things: 1. Is the license transferable? From what I see, the retail version seems to allow this but as the old hard drive is toast I can't uninstall or deactivate the other version of Win 10. 2.

show on the task bar and still show the tab when I hover my mouse over it but when I clicked it it did nothing.   Check to see if you have a window that is moved off screen (or located on another monitor).  Right-click the Taskbar icon's thumbnail when you have raised it and choose Move from the thumbnail's window menu.  Notice the change in mouse pointer but in your case you can not use it to drag.  What you can do however is use a cursor key to engage the mouse pointer on the window's title bar for a drag move.  Then drag move the window into view.  In the case where the window is on a different monitor you would also have the (simpler) alternative of using a  Win+Shift+Cursor  move.   Good luck Glenn Aldwinckle ---,"[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]"

"Hi, please forgive me if some of my questions seem silly. I really am not technically minded and computers confuse me! Due to problems I have encountered with the Windows Update, I have decided to back up my Toshiba Satellite C55 for the first time and I am unsure on how to. When searching online, it seems that doing a System Image Backup is not recommended, so what is? I want to create a back up just in case something bad happens so I will be able to reinstall everything. I have read on this forum, and have printed off for reference, 'how to make a full back up of your Windows 10 PC' which explains how to perform a System Image Backup and it is recommended on there that you connect an external storage drive. However, I do not have and cannot afford the £50 plus for an external drive :( I attempted to do a back up today using File History onto a USB stick. But even that is not straightforward :/ The photo below shows what files are set to back up and what folders are excluded I do not know why the folders are in the back up these folders or exclude these folders. There are some folders in the exclude section that I can only find in the Recycle Bin and they are not currently in my Users folders. Please can someone let me know which folders should or should not be backed up? Thank you Below is a screenshot that I took today of the Users folders. The following 8 folders are there, not the 10 folders shown above. Does this matter?  Worryingly, below is a screenshot that I took about a year ago, which shows some completely different folders to what are showing in the above screenshot in Users today. Are any of the folders showing above, in the old screenshot, which are not now in my Users folder, important? I have no idea what .android, .dvdcss, .fontconfig, 3D objects, Gihosoft Android Recovery are. Can these be deleted/uninstalled or would it be detrimental to the performance of my laptop? I would be devastated if I lost any of my personal files (it happened before and I vowed it would never happen again) but here I am, only NOW attempting to do back ups of my personal files and of my laptop!

"Hello this is Michael. The first screenshot you provided shows Cloud drives. I would remove those as that data is also in the cloud and on your computer. OneDrive and Dropbox files should be synced to the cloud so those do not need to be put on a USB normally. I would concentrate on backing up what is important to you. Documents, pictures, music, favorites. Some of those folders are not necessary to backup in that screenshot. Any folder that has a period in front (.android) is configuration information for devices like your mobile device that do not necessarily need to backed up. My advice is to keep it simple. Find what is the most important and include only those in your backup. I personally use OneDrive as my backup. It will depend on how much space is in your OneDrive or Dropbox and how much your backing up. Hope that helps.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

"Well the system image would work if you have an external drive to backup to. It will depend on how big the system image will be and how big your external disk is.

"Hi,  I recently started college and they were advising us to download the Office Student pack that was being offered free.  Which I did - from the official site and not the college one (just in case it'd been hacked).  Ever since whenever I try to open any browser apart from Microsoft Edge, I get the windows installer popup flashing up as though it's on a permanent loop.  It took me several attempts to download the software as I had forgotten that I'd installed the old Microsoft Word - which I think was the 2007 version -  from the disk I got with my old computer (back when you were given MS works, etc as a freebie with your computer).  I didn't have the disk but downloaded a tool from the MS site that would remove the software and allow a clean install of the new software.  The end result of this is as I said above - it's looping the installer pop up and it's so bad I can't use the browsers (or the Rootsmagic 7 software I also had on my pc and had used to work on my family tree - only the defunct Family Tree Maker software is viewable but I can no longer access my tree online through it so it's rather a waste of time using it).  I'm at the stage I'm ready the pc out of the window as I'm so frustrated.  Computers never used to be so difficult, when did it all change?  You used to be able to uninstall one software and install the new without all these problems.....

"Hi, I have a mcafee encrypted usb stick that has private and personal information on that I use to transfer files and work on. When I plugged in the stick I would see the usb stick on a drive, stating Locked and then an open folder system for me to start the mcafee program and enter my password. Once complete I could see the files on my USB stick and use them. This has worked fine on my laptop since I purchased it last year, after the recent update from windows this week the USB is recognised but will now only open with the Locked drive; when I click this I see a blank folder, as I cannot start the access program I cannot enter my password and unlock the stick. I know its not the stick as I used it at work this week and it has worked fine; then this morning I was using the stick on my wifes laptop (who at the time hadn't updated), now the laptop has updated and 'Hey Presto' the usb stick will not open now. Can anyone suggest how I can fix this. I have personal information on this stick (hence why its password protected), the last thing I want to do is move the files to an unprotected stick encase I lose it, all because of an update that I had no choice in taking on.

"Hi Melinda,  Important updates provide significant benefits, such as better protection from security or privacy threats. They also improve the reliability of your computer and software. If your software connects to an online service, important updates may be installed, if required, to maintain your access to the online service. Recommended updates address non-critical problems and help enhance your computing experience. You might also be offered new optional Office and Microsoft software. New software will not be installed automatically.  In regards with your concern, we suggest to run the Windows Update Troubleshooter to check and scan for corruption errors during the update.

"When I click on a desktop icon that is just a link to a site on the Internet, the site appears, then after about 3 seconds, the site disappears and the screen goes back to the desktop.  But when I click on desktop icons that are actual programs or files that I have installed, or are on my machine (installed from a CD/DVD or from a site on the Internet), there is no problem-works fine.

"Hi there, One of things I recommend you users do if the Store has a lot of apps to update is to pause all of them, then update the Store app first, restart the Store app, then update a few apps at a time. You can try creating a new user account to see if it helps with fixing the problem, or you can also try performing a repair upgrade since you have exhausting a number of options. http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-perform-a-repair-upgrade-using-the-windows/35160fbe-9352-4e70-9887-f40096ec3085 Reinstalling the Store app might also help, so, give that a try: Open Start, type: powershell Right click powershell then click Run as administrator At the command prompt, type the following command then hit Enter.

"Hey everyone, thanks for a bit of your time. I've been having a bit of a rough time with my Mic and Sound not working properly. As mentioned above, I have an Inspiron 15 5000 2in1 laptop. A good bit of time ago, the default Realtek drivers were giving me issues (static noise while playing) so I changed to the default High Definition Audio Device drivers and all was good again. However, a few days ago, all of those drivers gave a ""Code 45"" error, describing how they weren't connected and the chosen device was an Epson projector I used a while ago (it's usually just at the bottom of the list unused). Now all of the sound and mic stopped working. I went into device managers, uninstalled the drivers, and restarted my device and they reappeared updated but still showed as disconnected but the Realtek ones somehow appeared again (hadn't been there before). I tried again but the Realtek ones prevailed but the High Definition Audio Device ones did not reappear. Currently, when I open up the sound card menu, I get two drivers or devices in Playback Devices. I get the same Epson Projector UD Device titled Speakers and the Realtek Audio titled ""Speakers/Headphones."" Under recording I have the Microphone and Stereo Mix both by Realtek listed. Currently, the Realtek is working perfectly fine but the mic in my earbuds (default apple ones) and the one in my laptop no longer detect any sound. I've run the trouble shooter for audio, recording, and hardware devices but none returned any issues. The audio one did seem to prefer the Microphone device over the Stereo Mix but neither work. At the moment, I get decent audio with only slight crackling but the mic still does not work. My reference for the mic working is the green bars in the sound menu and the voice detection in Discord. Less than a week ago, all of this was working and it has me stumped after several restarts, a system restore to 3 days ago, and much frustration.  I'm not particularly tech savvy so if I missed any important information that might help you come up with a solution, please do not hesitate to let me know and I will provide it to the best of my ability. Thanks again!","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]"

" Being at zero out of one-hundred-and-fifty points is kind of a good sign that I haven't hit the maximum amount of points, since I haven't earned any points. The bit about private mode also is totally wrong since points can still be earned as long as you are signed into the correct account, I know that since I used to use one of those modes when I was forced to use a public computer for a time; and in any case, that isn't the issue since I wasn't in private mode. It also wasn't an issue with the counting not appearing, it was a problem with searches not granting points, but it seems to have solved itself again without any ""help"".","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]"

"Our charity's website (https://JenniferAnn.org) is not showing correctly in Bing search listings. The site is properly configured with the title of ""Jennifer Ann's Group"" which is the name of our charity founded in 2006. However Bing has changed the listing to instead show ""Murder of Jennifer Ann Crecente - Official Site."" Unfortunately, yes, Jennifer Ann Crecente was murdered in 2006 and it was her death which prompted the formation of this 501(c)(3) organization but this does not excuse Bing unilaterally misrepresenting us in their search results. Our work is not focused on Jennifer's murder but rather helping other young people recognize and avoid abusive dating relationships. When people search for information about ""Jennifer Ann's Group"" they should be able to find our website - not be presented with an ""official site"" for Jennifer's murder. For two days we have sent multiple requests to Bing / Microsoft through their automated systems as well as to their Twitter accounts in an attempt to correct the manner in which our organization is being misrepresented. There has been no response. Is there an official process to correct this? Or a person who can assist? Is there a procedure we can follow to ensure this does not happen again? While we recognize that this may not seem like a significant issue to some, it is terribly frustrating and hurtful for those of us who miss Jennifer and are working every day to help other adolescents avoid her fate. The fact that Bing would ignore our content and replace our name with one of its own choosing is genuinely distressing and offensive. The work we do is very important to us and it is not acceptable for Bing to define our work like this. Please note: we are aware of the information regarding Bing's selection of a title for a web page (https://blogs.bing.com/webmaster/2014/06/23/how-does-bing-choose-the-title-for-my-web-page). Our HTML and associated metatags / title / content reflect our name as ""Jennifer Ann's Group."" Bing appears to have used content from Wikipedia to select the title they have applied.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]"

We have requested help:  If you know of somebody who we can speak with at Bing we would like to speak with them.

This means you'll have to go buy an external hard drive with at least 60GB free. But bearing in mind that the cost of a 60GB hard disk and one with a 500GB capacity is barely a matter of cents, you'll be better off with the large capacity drive which you can use for other purposes later.  To create the Recovery drive, hit Windows key to open the Start screen with the tiles and start typing the word ""Recovery"". You'll see the option called ""Create a recovery drive"" appear on the right. Click that and then click Next. Here's a screenshot.

The actual size image appears in a preview window with the loading throbber icon over it as usual. But after it loads, the preview image shrinks to a thumbnail. I don't believe it's supposed to be doing this, as I've used Bing Images search for a long time and it only recently started doing this. Here are screenshots to illustrate. Searched Image is loading... Searched image loaded, but shrinks. This is counter-intuitive and frustrating, as if I wanted to save the image, I'd have to click it and then I could save. But it always shrinks the image. I originally thought it was Firefox, but it is definitely Bing. Is there any way to stop Bing from shrinking my searched preview images?

"I'm having this exact same issue. I've tried the Bing image search in Chrome, IE, Edge, and Firefox all with the same results.  I even searched for images on Microsoft.com and they also shrink down to a frustrating size. This does not seem to be an isolated issue in regards to the image source.  I think this issue started within the last couple weeks but I could be wrong. I didn't really pay attention that closely.  when I click on the magnifying glass that has a tool tip of ""search within this image"" I see a higher quality version of the image that takes up the vertical viewing area as I would expect the initial preview to do.  Also, when I look at the files being sent over the network I can see a larger version of the image being sent to the browser than what is being displayed. I'm thinking this has something to do with the script on the search page incorrectly sizing the image to the portal for the preview.","[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]"

Skype UWP and the classic Skype for Windows Desktop are two very different Skype applications, with different features and options.   Birthday notifications has newer been a feature of Skype UWP application.

"Hi David,  Thank you for posting your query on the Microsoft Communities.  Sorry to know that you are unable to connect the Bluetooth headset to Acer tablet.

If yes, check the status of the device. a. Open Device Manager b. Find the Bluetooth device. Right-click on it and under 'General' tab, check the status of the device.  Follow these steps: Method 1: Try using the troubleshooter from this article and then follow other troubleshooting steps as well. Why isn't Windows finding my Bluetooth or other wireless device? http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/why-isnt-windows-finding-device  Method 2: If none of the steps help from the above article, you may try to restart the Bluetooth service and then check if you are able to connect the device. a) Press Windows key + R, type services.msc b) Right-click on Bluetooth support service. c) Now, click on Stop and Restart it.

Before posting this I obviously checked all the normal places.  First off - Googling this I got this advice: This made no sense - using Skype on Mac OS and Chrome. The propriety app for Mac has no ability - so you have to use a browser. I can change my name - and lots of other stuff under edit profile - but my picture is locked.  So I followed some advice that said to do it in Outlook - since Microsoft and Skype are linked in some way. I went on to my Outlook account. Two things came to light - 1. I have a different picture already active on this account and 2. It said (IE confirmed) that my Skype and Outlooked were linked. Interesting conflicting data here perhaps since the images are different. If the accounts were linked - the images should surely be the same. I changed the image on my Outlook account - but it did nothing to change the one on my Skype account. I'm lost!   ,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

I'm using Skype V 7.56(776) on MacBook Pro Retina 15 mid 2015 - 2.8ghz i7 16GB RAM 1600 Mhz DDR3  I did as you suggested and was able to change my profile picture this morning - so thanks very much.  A few notes in passing:  Clicking on my profile picture as you suggest does nothing on Mac version. But DOUBLE clicking it (or clicking on the inset camera icon) does open a dialogue box where one can find a new picture. I did this and it worked - but it never actually gave me the text or written option as you list at point 2 - IE 'change picture' - I think it just assumes that's what you want to do..... anyway, like I say, it worked. So thanks again.  What still does NOT work - and really, it's at this point only for those that don't have the app installed - is I still can not change my picture through a browser. I log in to Skype.com and go to Profile and Personal Information and I can change my name and address here - but not my image. Who knows why!? - Anyway. Since I got it cracked through the app itself this morning - and the image has updated online.... I'm happy - so I won't bother you guys any further.  All the best!  ","[1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]"

"I'm about to pull my hair out. To make matters worse, Skype's ""Customer Support"" is an endless loop of ""Getting in touch with someone"" through means of a virtual person that redirects you to a contact page that redirects you to the virtual customer service page again. I'm REALLY STARTING TO GET ANNOYED. ANYWAY, the problem I'm having has existed for ages for me. Every time, and I do mean EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I open the skype app on my phone, it resets my Desktop Skype status to ""Available"" from ""Do not Disturb"". To make matters worse, I have found no conceivable way to stop this from happening. Turning off all notifications on skype mobile does nothing. There is also not visible way to change skype statues on mobile. As a result, every time I try to use it, it sets me to Available on Desktop and all notifications start playing through all three linked devices I have (Desktop, Laptop, and Mobile). To Clarify: I recently got a brand new phone and am running the latest version of the skype mobile app. Please note: IF YOUR SOLUTION IS TO ROLL BACK THE VERSION, I might as well just uninstall it at that point. IT TAKES LESS EFFORT TO UNINSTALL SKYPE THAN IT DOES TO ROLL IT BACK. I literally just want to stay Do Not Disturb. I am always DND on Skype, and I do not want to be set to available. Another ""Solution"" That isn't a solution is muting every chat individually. That is a lot of effort to go through for something that should be a SIMPLE FREAKING FIX! Not to mention, it defeats the entire purpose. Please, for the love of GOD, solve my problem.

Here's how: Turning off the Notification for conversations option will show your presence as Do Not Disturb, which lets your contacts know you aren't currently available. This will also stop all incoming message notifications, however, you will still receive Skype calls.   For more information, you may refer to this FAQ. If you have further questions, please do not hesitate to reply to this post. Thank you! Julie_S1Karl Skype Community Moderator ","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

"Is there a way to contact Skype support via email to reset a password? I tried unsuccessfully to reset the password to my Skype account by answering the security questions one too many times.

Unfortunately email1 is from a previous work email (no longer valid) and email2 is tied to an account that has the mailbox full and cannot receive messages.

"Hi StephanieSkypeUser and welcome to the Skype Community! Password reset codes are sent by the system for verification that the user requesting access to the account is the true account owner. Skype support cannot send the reset code for your password manually, as this will be sent by the system automatically to the registered security information of your account (which in your case are the two email addresses) if the owner requests a password reset.   Since you have access to the second email address of the account, you can try deleting a few spam or junk emails which you no longer deem important, The reset code will be sent once so you do not have to worry that you'll be spammed. After you successfully reset your password and signed in to your account, I advice that you update your security info and include your third email address to the list of your security info so you can use this email to reset your password. Please refer to this link for additional details.    Let us know if you need further clarification/assistance.    Thank you. ","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"Once again, i must appeal to the wisdom and kindness of the clever-user community. I translate lots of PowerPoint presentations from French. These are sometimes full of quotation marks, which in French traditionally look like this: « wibble » I want to make them look like this: “wibble”. Basically, i want to change [guillemet + space] or [guillemet + non-breaking space] to [“] (a sixty-six quote mark). Back in the day, in an earlier version of PPT, i could just use Find&Replace to change, e.g., [« ] to [“]. (In Word, that is still the case). It would take seconds to do it; now it takes minutes. The Find feature in PPT does not distinguish between « "" and “. In fact, enter [«] in the search box in the top right of the window and it finds most cases of "" and “ but NOT «. Use the Find&Replace box, and it detects a different wrong set of characters. It is a complete mess. I tried a macro that contains the line: oRng.Characters.Replace Chr$(174), ""§"" (the idea being to subsequently change § to “) Chr$(174) being theoretically [«] – but it doesn't pick up on any instances. (BTW the code works when applied to other characters). Have i just got the wrong character code? How can i find out? Is there no easy way of checking the code for each character in VB?

"Thanks for the reply!  I tried 171/187 as you suggested, but to no avail.  Then it occurred to me to use the inelegant method – just:  Characters.Replace ""«"", ""§""   I can then follow up with equally inelegant operations using Find&Replace to get rid of the extra spaces, converting [§ ] to [“], etc.  I can then bundle these dirty mini-routines into a single hot-key function using iKey. So VBA does distinguish « after all, if only from within macros. Despite what i said. If you really want to work on a proper way of doing it (and someone really ought to repair the quote marks issues in PPT one day) then i'll gladly send you a file; but would you believe i've never used iCloud - i only just uploaded my first file, but i don't know how to share it.

In Windows 10 1607 and earlier, you can find your apps by opening Start > Settings > System > Apps and Features. In Windows 10 1703 and later, you can ind your apps by opening Start > Settings > Apps > Apps and Features. Select the app then click Uninstall. For legacy apps, you can open Programs and Features Press Windows key + R Type: appwiz.cpl Hit Enter Select the application you want to uninstall then click Change/Uninstall n the command bar.

"Since the drive is apparently full you need to do some emergency cleanup. Windows has been traditionally very ""cranky"" when it is low on drive space. And it's definition of low has been based on percentage free, rather than absolute values. Which now leads to the ludicrous situation where Windows starts complaining about low drive space even with 10's or hundreds of GB, (yes GB) of free space. Start by typing diskclean in the start menu. This will locate the built in hard drive cleanup tool. This will help you delete unneeded files.

"I have a new Dell Inspiron laptop 15 5000 which came with Office 365 and Skype free 60 minutes of calls per month. I had previously used Skype on my android phone with a friend on her Mac laptop. When I first set up the new laptop, Skype seemed to set itself up after I synced my contacts. My friend is moving out of the country in a few days, and we were practicing doing video calls on my new Dell. She called me first, and she was already a contact. I did not know how to answer the call because I had no notification buttons on my open Skype screen. I managed to disconnect the call, and she called me back. This time, there was a notification box at the lower right and had the answering options of audio or video. I picked video and we connected. She saw me on her end, and she also saw herself in the little box in the corner...so that must mean her camera was working. On my end, I saw myself in the little corner box, but I never saw her...just her avatar in the center of the screen. Our audio was fine, just not the video. I have a new Dell so I am sure I must have the latest version of Skype, but there is a problem. I have no menu, and the only place I have to click on the Skype page which first comes up from the desktop is Check Account or Invite a Friend. On the left side of the page, there is only an option to check my Contacts List.  When I click Check Account, I find an option for Settings, but there is no Tools or Options within the Settings list. There is a Privacy Settings, but it all it does is show my profile. The self help stuff I have found so far from Googling is from Skype support which says to go to Tools and then to Options and then to Automatically Receive Video and make sure that either Anyone or Contact List Only is checked...that if nothing is checked then I won't be able to see any video.  So, I would do that if I could, but I have no way to get to Tools in the first place. There is nothing to click, no options at all. I really need to figure this out quickly. Is my Skype software corrupted? Do I need to download it? If I did what would happen to my setup? It came on my Dell, so I never downloaded anything.

"Hi all, I have a skype number that we use for our office. Our thought process was that a Skype number would be handier, since there are three of us and we're often out of the office. That way we wouldn't miss calls. However, we are often finding that we miss calls anyway. We have a mac laptop each (running latest copy of skype) and iPhone (running latest copy of skype), and we find that when a call comes in, sometimes one of them will ring, sometimes two or more, but sometimes none of them will, despite being signed in. I can look at Skype on my phone, which will then update and tell me I have three missed calls. I cannot seem to get to the bottom of what is causing this. Is it because we have too many devices/people logged into the same account at the same time? Or is this an inherent problem within Skype itself? Should I only run Skype on the phone perhaps, and sign out if we're not the one 'marked as watching the phone'. No idea. Having recently lost a contract because we missed an important call I'm at the point of cancelling Skype and reverting to a landline, even though I know we'll miss calls if nobody is there.

"Here, people can live in places that are physically remote by tens, many times hundreds of kilometres. Video calling when it became accessible, was a great improvement to social accessibility and a sense of validated contact.  Because of these obvious benefits, it has been enthusiastically used as a post-surgical checkup tool, an integral part of mental health outreach programs, the de-facto primary method of ordinary medical consultations, a way to augment the life experiences of students too young, or physically or financially impeded in ability to travel.   It's true that - as others have commented - Skype became the descriptive name for this practice, just as carbonated cola drinks are all ""Coke"" in the venacular or electric guitars were all ""Fenders"". That's indisputable proof of brand penetration.  And now - with much of that in shreds due simply to launch of an immature product - people are being told they should ""wait and see"" what the next upgrade brings. There's not even the offer of temporarily preserving the old system at (an arbitrarily suggested figure) say $2/month. It's genuinely incomprehensible, especially in the light of Skype being a brand of Microsoft - a company whose founder personally supports a strong charter of social improvements.  My extended family and I can readily work around most of the inconveniences with negligible to modest cost, but I'm perfectly aware this situational mobility is not available to everyone here in my country.

"Hello Brian,  Welcome to Skype Community!  It's unusual that you are not seeing a comma on your keyboard when signing in as it is one of the most commonly used characters.  If you have changed your keyboard settings, I suggest that you revert it to the default one.  Alternatively, you may find a comma online or from a text message and copy it. Then, paste it on the log in page of the Skype app.  I hope the information above helps.  Regards,","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]"
"I agree that it is unusual that I see no comma but please note, this lack of a comma on the sign-in keyboard only occurred after the recent update.  For the two years prior to this, I had no problem locating a comma and logging in.  Previous to that, I had a blackberry with hard keys so the situation was different.    I ultimately did log in by going to another application which presented the full keyboard, write my login name, copy the text and then paste it into the skype login screen.  Once logged in, the application presented the full keyboard with the comma and all the other characters.  Prior to getting the idea to copy/paste, I went to the local Microsoft store (The Valley Fair shopping mall in San Jose California) and I talked to one of the employees at the store.  Hey, Skype is a Microsoft product after all.  The employee was stumped as well and then went to consult one of the service techs.  After consulting the service tech, he came back telling me that this same situation occurs on the Samsung phone as well (I guess that the service tech had a Samsung).  That is when I went across the aisle to the Apple store (yes, it is really located just across the aisle) and while looking for an after market external keyoard I got the copy/paste idea.  I did try working with my keyboard preferences but to no avail.  I do believe that the specific keyboard that is presented to the user is ultimately determined  by the app and, in the recent update, some coder at Microsoft overlooked an important detail about the keyboard.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]"

"Hi,   Method 1: When the photos are on external storage or memory card. Computer recognizes the external storage & even sees the phone's folders, you can copy the photos from the folder and paste it on your computer. Method 2: When photos are on the phone's internal memory and not on the external memory card. When you hook up like this, all you see is what's on the external microSD card, you cannot see or access what's on the phone's memory. It is possible however to move the photos from the phone's internal memory to the external memory card. Click on the Folder widget on the main screen (or ""My Stuff"" from the Settings screen), then at the top, look at the tabs - click on the middle one to view the phone's memory contents. Now click on the lower left ""notebook-like"" icon and then click ""Move"" and then select the photos you want to move, then click Move. Now it should be highlighting the right tab - the external memory - so choose the folder you want to move the photos to, or create a new folder, or just use the current folder. That's it. Now you will be able to access these photos via the computer/USB cable method because they are now on the microSD card. For further help please contact the device manufacturer.

"Hello Antonio,  Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.  As per your description, I understand that the two IWDAud Devices load over and over again and it impact the running applications including Mozilla Firefox. I will certainly help you with the issue.  1. Have you recently made any changes on your computer, prior to the issue? 2. Which forum suggested you that the issue is related with KB3022345? 3. Is there any Windows Update which has been failed recently? As of now, I recommend you to go through following methods:  Method 1:  Please put the computer in Clean Boot mode and check if you are getting the error message.  Boot the computer in a Clean Boot state and check the status. A clean boot helps to verify if any third party application service or startup item is causing this issue.  Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow steps under “How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot” in the article to boot to normal startup.  If issue persists, scan your computer using SFC Scan to fix the possible corruption of Windows system components.  Method 2:  I would suggest you to perform SFC scan and check if that helps. The sfc/scannow command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.    Note: System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.  If issue continues, please reply with the details and the screenshot of the error message.  Refer the link for How to include a screenshot in your post Hope this information is helpful.

Once done, open Skype, select Tools > Options > Audio settings, then in the Speakers drop-down choose the playback device you want to use. Make sure that the sound devices match. Otherwise, your audio input and output may not come through the headset/speaker.   Moreover, please check if your audio driver is up-to-date.

"I use Latexit app to produce beautiful latex equation. When using Office 2011 in MacOS X it worked fine.

From Word I can drag the very same equation and drop it into Powerpoint 2016 MAcOSX. Why on earth I can't do this straightforward from LatexIt to PowerPoint?

"Hi Wjn101,   1.   Since when are you facing this issue? 2.   Did you make any changes on your computer? 3.   Does this issue occur with all the programs or any particular program?   Method 1:   Step 1:   I would suggest you to boot the computer into Safe Mode and check if the issue occurs there, here are the steps:   Refer:   Advanced startup options including safe mode http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode    Step 2:  If the issue does not occur in Safe Mode, you can try performing clean boot and check if it helps,   Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. If yes, you may have to contact the program manufacturer for any updates or uninstall and re-install the program.

"Totally ridiculous how much of my time this bug wasted over the last few weeks, but I finally figured out how to not get Outlook 2016 to disappear in Windows 10 when minimized.  Other sites on web advised to right click on the button in the task bar and un-check the ""Hide when minimized"" item.  But when I right clicked, that item did not appear on the menu.  (It may appear in earlier versions of Windows or Office.)  In Office 2016 with Windows 10, here's the solution that worked for me:  Right click on taskbar. Select Taskbar settings. Scroll down and click on to ""Select which icons appear..."" Turn on the Microsoft Outlook icon. Now, exit settings.  Right click on the Outlook icon (typically in the tray at the bottom right corner of your taskbar) Unselect ""Hide when minimized"" in that menu.  You should be good to go now.

"Hi Michelle,   Welcome to the Skype Community forum.   I do understand the inconvenience you have faced. But to be honest with you, the only other way to use Skype on your Mac OS X 10.7.5 is to update it to at least Mac OS X 10.9 or higher. Otherwise, using a supported device is an option.   Skype is always making improvements, such as enhanced quality, better reliability, and improved security. Because we want everyone to experience the best Skype has to offer, it's sometimes necessary to retire older versions of Skype, and Skype enabled devices. Unsupported Skype enabled devices, and platforms may experience problems with calls and chats, lost or dropped calls and instant messages, or could stop working completely.

"Hi Christopher,   The Skype name is the username you created when you first joined Skype, other than your email address or phone number. If you are using an email address or phone number when signing in on Skype, then you have a default Skype name that has the word “live:” Also, creating an account using a Skype name or username is no longer available.   You can see the Skype name of your account below your display name on your Skype profile. If you want others to find you on Skype, then they can use the Skype name, email address or other information you put on your Skype profile.   https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10858   Hope this information helps.

I don't remember it so I try to connect to my yahoo account with which my skype account is linked. I need my Yahoo application for this..., I don't have my phone and I don't remember the password for the recovery email for my yahoo email, and the recovery email of this email need security confirmation from another email whose password I don't remember anymore (I had 7 years when I've done it). Long Story Short: I can't recover my account by email till my phone arrives. So the people from Microsoft offered me an alternative, loved them for that. I know my account details, so surely my profile was confirmed and I got a recovery link through my actual email, a gmail one. My problem: they ask me to write my account login, which is fine, but when I press next, nothing happened. I inspected the page and this is what the console show me: Yes, I pressed that button 39 times this time (and about 100 times before).

"Hello MariaBuie,   Welcome to Skype Community forum!  I know how important this is for you.  If you've been invited to a Skype conversation either via a link or by email, it's easy to join, even if you don't have Skype.  If you're joining from a mobile device, Skype will launch on your mobile. If you don't have Skype installed on your mobile, you'll need to install it before you can join a conversation and click on the conversation link again.  If the link you receive isn't working, check that the link was copied correctly (if you copied and pasted it) or typed correctly (if you typed it into your browser). Also keep in mind that the creator of the conversation can change the settings at any time, which might result in you not being able to join the conversation.

"Hello MariaBuie,   Thank you for your reply.  As long as the Group profile is active, all people whom you sent the link will have the opportunity to join the group and there is no expiration for this.  To change the settings, please go through these steps: (You need to sign in to the Skype app to perform this action)  1. Click on the Group profile picture or click Settings (gear icon). A new window will pop-up. 2. Under Administrator settings, you will be given two options: Make chat history available to everyone and Make a link for anyone to join.  Make chat history available to everyone - means old chat will be available even to new member of the group. Make a link for anyone to join - allows you to share the URL for new contacts to join the group.

I went back to my rewards page and refreshed the page and VIOLA my 10 points vanished!The counter  went back to where it was the Day before! :/ Any search makes me Zero points,except for just now I got 10 points for doing a manual search from bing.com.Well that 10 is all I got and again when I went to my Rewards page and refresh it,my points dropped back again!!!

"Mmmmm yes, seems strange as I get it to the same numbers with my 10 computer, my 7 computer and my android 4.4 (new KitKat netbook! I am therefor pretty certain that it is very unlikely to be my end! As I stated this all started after I raised a problem and Skyp, Microsoft escalated that problem that ended with a large part of skype not working whilst the problems was researched. Since that time, certain numbers, mostly French in my case, and as regular as clockwork get a hissing white noise between the dialling and response. As I stated I think that it may be something to do with the hand shake as certain exchanges seem to be too quick to respond.  I had the following email:- Service Request <1349432902>  and I am with Microsoft Global Escalation Services. I am very sorry to hear that you are experiencing issues with calling French numbers I am currently investigating this issue for you to determine what is preventing you from reaching out to those numbers properly.

" Bryan,  The main problem I see with the solution above is that most businesses do not have the capability for an iPhone or iPad to use AirPlay to connect to the projectors or TVs found in conference rooms, ballrooms, etc. where business people given PowerPoint presentations.  I think the best solution for any mobile device (iOS or Android) is to have PowerPoint running on a Windows or Mac PC, connected to the projector, and then have the mobile device connected via Bluetooth to the PC/Mac.   The reason this is important is that more customers are using TVs vs. projectors.  Normal laser pointers do not work on them.  Also, if you are in a larger room with multiple displays, the laser pointer cannot display on all screens.  I saw a person use the Android remote app today and it was impressive.  It would be a great addition for Microsoft to support this.  Thanks!  DeWayneTammy Hughes","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
  I agree with Tammy on how businesses are set up: laptops connected to projectors or HDTVs and the need to present standing up while pointing to things on the large screen needs either an external device that acts as a powerpoint presenter tool OR the old Android app that worked wonders and had functionality that is simply not there in the iOS app after so much time- I mentioned the Android app funcctionality in my email last year...

"I am working for my company to add captions to our PowerPoint classes.  We have .srt files for the captions embedded in the videos, which are .MP4s.  We are using PowerPoint 2016.

However, on Windows, when we use those same embedded videos, no captions appear and there is no CC control in the player bar to turn them on or off.  We have used STAMP as a workaround, but it is not ideal because turning off captions would require the educator to go through the whole project and turn them off slide-by-slide prior to the class.

"Hello, I noticed there's a bug when someone sends you a file multiple times with the same name, if you click the link for file received in Skype window you get the very first file that was sent but Explorer renames the file to add (1), (2) and so on and it's confusing.

"Hi Ruwim, I understand the renaming behaviour is intentional (and very useful) in Explorer, the problem is with Skype window that tells you ""file received"" and you get the first version when you click directly on the link to open it instead of the last file received. This has happened to me, someone sent me a report document that was changed but couldn't find any changes when opened via Skype and missed important information of the report that was added. Now I have to warn everyone that they need to right-click the file, select ""Show in folder"" and open the last file received via Explorer (that shows correctly the renamed file), this is annoying and time wasting. IMHO it would be more useful to create new folders with name of the folder based on date and time (e.g. ""2017_09_28_14_35_58"") where new files can be received and if they have the same name, Skype should report the renamed version, this way Skype received files would not contain lots of obsolete files received from other people which makes finding the last received file even more difficult.

"Dear member of Microsoft Community,    May I introduce myself. I am Paul SYLVAIN, a computer programmer in the Civil Engineering field.  I have written many concrete programs in the 1980's that I would need to recover actually in 2017 because they were very helpful for my works. But the actual computer that I use is a 64 bit PC which is not compatible with the  1980 ones. And one of the very interesting program was written in Gwbasic. I try to recuperate it but  I failed.

Windows RT runs on a different processor type from normal windows.  Programs written for normal windows won't run on RT.

Nowhere have I seen any talk of it encrypting files on RT systems - because the payload won't run on RT.  The MSRC statement doesn't mention Windows RT.

"Hello again,  thanks for the feedback.   The ""custom delimiter"" option gives you the tool to determine what character is used as the delimiter in your data set. It does NOT cover the possibilities of mixed delimiters in a data source. Mixing delimiters is not good practice and should be discouraged. The custom delimiter in Power Query is actually quite powerful, because you can define a delimiter that contains more than one character, thus saving additional steps to clean up the resulting data. So, the delimiter could be a string like ""  -  "" (i.e. space, space, dash, space, space) and Power Query will happily slice the data when it finds that string, whereas importing a file with the old tools only allowed for ONE character to be the delimiter.  But the delimiter must always be the same throughout the data set. That's the whole idea of a delimiter.   Files from multiple sources can easily be handled with Power Query. Each file may need different handling for delimiters etc. Take each file at a time and determine its delimiter. Then combine the results of different queries as required.","[1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0]"

Contacts are saved on Skype's servers, you can access them by logging in to your account across all supported platforms and devices.  Skype accounts were migrated to Microsoft October last year, although users with legacy accounts (Skype Name-created accounts) still need to fully update their accounts to enjoy the benefits of a Microsoft account.   One of the perks of having an updated account is that, you can sign in across Microsoft services and products by using either your Skype Name or your email address. You might have signed in to Skype using the associated email address of your account without fully updating it yet, which resulted in a newly created Skype account.   If you want to know if you have multiple accounts, please go to this link and enter the email address and then click Continue. After doing this, you'll be able to see all the active Skype accounts associated with your email address.  Remember to always sign in using the credentials you used to originally create the account.

"Hi Sheila,   Good Day!   Please be advised that if Skype detects a weak connection, it will reduce the quality to try and stop the call from dropping altogether.    With that being said, we strongly advised you to use Wi-Fi instead of mobile data.  As Skype have required bandwidth that will depend on the type of calls you want to make.

"You can only resize a window that is not maximized.  In the top right corner of every window, regardless of what application it is, you see icons to minimize, maximize/restore and the X for exit. When a window is maximized, it cannot be resized. You need to click the maximize/restore icon to restore the window. It is a toggle switch. The first screenshot shows what it looks like in a maximized window that takes up the whole screen. The second screenshot shows what it looks like if the window is not maximized. This window's borders can be dragged.     Another quick way in Windows 7 and higher to see windows side by side is to select one window, hold down the Window key on your keyboard and hit the right arrow. That will send the window to the right hand side of the screen and it will take up half of the monitor. In Windows 10 you now can click any of the other open windows and it will be arranged on the left hand side of the screen.

I installed skype at the same time with all the consequent updates since.  After I posted my message, my Mozilla Firefox crashed, and then the Finder on the MacBook and has crashed for every attempt since to open them. My desktop no longer shows the documents I had on it with no bar or search possibility.  So I cannot take a screen shot of the profile to account attempt process. I have tried to log in to skype from my phone with the new password and the same loop occurs. There was no message before I was unceremoniously logged out of Skype. I was in the middle of writing an IM message.  I am taking my commuter to be checked for a virus or other fault.  Has my account been suspended because of the repeated log in attempts?

"Hi there Jeremiah23  If you are using a Mac OS 10.7, then you wouldn't able to use Skype on this device unless you update your OS to the latest version. Skype is no longer supported on Mac OS X 10.8 and lower. Users who are using unsupported platforms might experience issue with calling, messaging, signing in or the application could stop working completely. See this link for the full list of unsupported platforms and retired versions. Affected users can still use Skype on supported platforms and as long as they meet the system requirements.   Accounts might get temporarily suspended if the system detects multiple failed log in attempts, this is a system security measure to prevent anyone to have access to the account for possible account takeover.

"Would I need to use all three of these match types or are they all the same because there are no spaces: northdakotamaps ""northdakotamaps"" [northdakotamaps] Thanks Mark","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Hi, Julie! Thank you for your question, and Happy Saturday!   If you were to use all three match types with that keyword, the system would have some conflict deciding on what to serve. Generally speaking, the system usually goes for the most exact/specific match to the query, but there have been quite a few times where the system doesn't display an ad because of the multiple match type conflict. Therefore, it would be in your best interests to decide on 1 or 2 match types instead of all 3.  Now, choosing the right match type depends on your advertising goal. If you are looking for as much traffic as possible, even if the query may not be 100% what you are advertising, I would select the broad match type. If your objective is to draw towards a certain user, but don't want to limit the keyword too much, then select the phrase match type. But, if you only want your ad to serve if a user types in your keyword exactly, with nothing else in the query, your best option is exact match.  You can find out more about match types in the following links:  - What are keyword match types, and how do I use them?  - Using broad match and broad match modifier  - Keyword match options  If you have any other questions or concerns about this, feel free to reply to this response, chat in, or contact our Support Team for your region.

I saw that the icon had changed slightly and saw that the icons of all my .ppsx files had slightly changed and all the .ppsx files now open as a slide show and no longer in PP as an edit file.   Don’t know what happened but think that when you work in Power Point and save the file as a.ppsx it really does not save it as a.ppsx but as a .pptx (as it says it must in the Options in the PP program!!) by changing how it opens afterwards it has magically adopted the.ppsx and changed all the files with that suffix to open as shows!  Think it bypasses the glitch in the actual programme where it states in Options – Save that it must save as a presentation with no alternative such as a show.  In Power Point click on File then on Options and then on Save . There it says ""save files in this format"" there are four or five options but all are Presentations and there is no option to select anything else. Although when you select Power Point Show when you save the file it subliminaly saves it as a Presentation as the Options lays down.

"In Microsoft excel how do you lookup a certain value in a row and then look up another value in that row and then count the amount of times that second value appears in the row is the question. So in other words, the first value identifies the row the second value identifies what to look for in that row then instead of returning that exact value it returns the amount of times that value shows up in the specific row.  Example: So lets say you have a workweek sheet and a workweek summary sheet. On the workweek sheet it highlights the workers and the work done at different times during the day. On the summary Sheet it uses that data to tell you who (Value 1)  did what assignment (Value 2) and how many times they did it (Adding it). Of course that person would be doing different things during the day so it needs to be able to tell the difference (case sensitive). It does not need to tell you what time they did it since its based on a week that would be unnecessary data it just needs to tell you how many times they did a assignment during that week. And since persons may change through out the week once you type in a name to search and work assignment it should auto change its total(automated system i am looking for) .  Example code that didn't work but this is what I came up with:  =MATCH(Summary!$G$2,INDEX(Tuesday!$B$2:$E$58,MATCH(Summary!A5,Tuesday!$A$2:$A$58),)) Summary!A5 = Would be the person I look for in a row. this is a vertical lookup of names ( summary sheet ) Summary!$G$2 = Would be the assignment to look for on the workweek sheet but this ( text to look at ) is on the ( summary sheet ) Tuesday!$B$2:$E$58 = Would be the assignments to search through ( workweek sheet ) Tuesday!$A$2:$A$58 = Would be the row of names to search through ( workweek sheet ) Its like a two way lookup but on the second look up it looks at the whole row and identifies all the matching values/text in the row and adds the amount of times they show up.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]"

Somehow I have solved it.   I went to the properties of a file saved as .ppsx which would open in power point in the edit mode instead of opening as a slide show.

I saw that the icon had changed slightly and saw that the icons of all my .ppsx files had slightly changed and all the .ppsx files now open as a slide show and no longer in PP as an edit file.   Don’t know what happened but think that when you work in Power Point and save the file as a.ppsx it really does not save it as a.ppsx but as a .pptx (as it says it must in the Options in the PP program!!) by changing how it opens afterwards it has magically adopted the.ppsx and changed all the files with that suffix to open as shows!  Think it bypasses the glitch in the actual programme where it states in Options – Save that it must save as a presentation with no alternative such as a show.,"[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]"

"Hi Stephanie,  Welcome to the Skype Community forum.  I can see why you are concerned. Let me provide you an information regarding this.  Skype is always making improvements, such as enhanced quality, better reliability, and improved security. Because we want everyone to experience the best Skype has to offer, it's sometimes necessary to retire older versions of Skype, and Skype enabled devices. These decisions are hard to make, but will enable us to focus our efforts on transitioning Skype from a peer-to-peer video and chat app to a modern, mobile friendly cloud architecture.  That being said, you must at least have an Android version 6.0 or higher to be able to download and install Skype. If your device is no longer supported, you can stay in touch with friends and family using another Skype supported device. The latest versions of Skype for all supported devices are available here.

All in order to get the latest Android Marshmallow with the new mobile, so I can continue using Skype; which doesn't operate on my Note II anymore using Android 4.4.2 Kit Kat !!  Of course I've tried upgrading my Galaxy Note II to install Marshmallow which is another expense in terms of time & effort and I hit the inevitable problems causing my Note II to crash with the inevitable business of having to flash a tar file of KitKat ( to get my Samsung Galaxy Note II working again ) using Odin. Not a pleasant experience after being up most of the night - trying to upgrade it.  Anyway I'm not impressed with Skype's attitude to all this - as in my opinion they could have quite easily continued to support Skype users using Android 4.4.2 KitKat by coming out with a Skype Lite version of Skype for mobile users like myself who are quite happy with their Note II mobiles.

First option is to create a new Microsoft account with a different email address/username and a correct date of birth. And I believe that this is the fastest and the most convenient way for you or if you really want to retain that email address/username, we can change the date of birth of it using these options:   Option 1: Provide a valid credit card number:   Note: Microsoft can only accept a US credit card.

"Hello Tyler,  Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community Forum.  As per the issue description your computer is not going to sleep. So, I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better. Try the below mentioned methods and see if it works for you.  Method 1 Try to run Power Troubleshooter which is built in troubleshooter and you may follow the steps mentioned below to run it.

"I have been using Skype on my iPhone for many years without issue.  I also use it on my desktop.  This morning it asked me to sign in again (I suspect it updated) so I did and then it asked for my birthday.  I entered the year incorrectly.  Now Skype wants me to get a parent to allow me to use it (even though I'm using it on my desktop right now and have been using it on my phone for several years).  I went to the site it suggested account.microsoft.com and tried to add myself as a family member, but it says I already am a family member and there are no others. I updated my birthday in the Profile and that worked.  I tried deleting the app from my phone and even powering down for a few minutes then reloading and the same thing happens. I tried chatting with Microsoft support and they said, ""not my problem"" and directed me to a link that doesn't work. I tried chatting with Skype support and they said that 10am PST time is not part of their working hours. So, I'm trying here.  I've wasted about two hours trying to get this to work again.  Is there any way to fix it without losing my account.  I'm afraid to log off on my desktop in case it won't let me back there either. BTW, the same app lets me log in with my MSFT email and password, but then, of course, all of my contacts and conversations are gone. Thanks, Tiffany Serface","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Hi Tiffany,   We apologize for the inconvenience.   Since Skype is under the umbrella of Microsoft, we have completely migrated and adopted Microsoft’s terms and condition.   With that, you are being asked for a “Parental Permission” is because the system detected that your age on file is under 13 years of age that’s why it was categorized as a “Child Account”.   But you don’t have to worry about this one because we can change the date of birth on your account, so you can have the correct age on file and for us to do it, we strongly recommend several options that you can choose on.   With that, I will be sending you a message and kindly check your email for the details. Thank you!   Marites P.   Skype Community Moderator","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"

"I did not have the same results Susan had. I have installed and uninstantiated many times with no luck and never get any choice to set permissions. In Android it is accept all or exit the install.  In my case, I am using an Android TV box (android 4.2) that came with Skype per-installed.  It worked back then.  Then Microsoft stopped my Android Skype from working by blocking the login until I logged in with a web browser and updated my account.  Before I had tried the PC web connection to insure my account was working, I used Google Play to update Skype.  BIG MISTAKE!  Now when I try to login from My android TV box with the newest version of Skype, it gets past the login, but does not start Skype correctly and has an error of no Internet connection.  This android device is connected via an Ethernet connection and I can work in Google play and browse the web in Chrome and Firefox.   I does not have a mobile connection or WiFi connection, so does report in the taskbar that there is no network, but that had not been an issue back in the day and other Internet type of programs work.

"Dell 5110 AMD version with W7 64 bit. This laptop works real crisp when it is not frozen. It is getting random total freezes that don’t seem to be caused by any specific task. It freezes whatever is on the screen, the mouse and keyboard. All that is left is the power button and the led’s. It may happen as soon as windows starts, after a couple hours of use or anywhere in between. Usually it seems to be pretty sudden and rarely gives any warning something is coming up. I have tried many of the things I have found to try and fix this.  Memtest and the Dell hardware tests all pass. The only added program on to what the OS has is chrome. I updated IE. Nothing has been done to likely get any malware but I have run Malwarebytes and superantispyware scans and they are clean. MSE scan comes out clean also. I have all current updates. Drivers are at a minimum and are all fine as far as what device manager says. I have run sfc scan and it always comes up clean. Seatools, Easeus surface test and chkdsk have been run, and all is fine. I have run defrag. When I watch task manager it is not running up the cpu or memory, those stay normal even when it freezes. Temps are not running up either.  This is the second clean install and both ended up with this same problem. Have done additional hd and memory tests and all pass. A video stress test was run and that was all fine. No way known to force bsod to get a memory dump as everything but the start button freezes when this happens. I tried a clean boot and it still freezes. I have had it in safe mode many times, including being on hours like that and no freezes ever. With that and the way it does very little if anything as a warning, no strange video or anything it seems to me this is probably not hardware, it seems to be some OS process?

I have one chat window constantly open (on all of my workstations), with my best buddy and the contact blocking occurred only on my home PC with that specific contact so far.

Once it shows in the email, click the ▼ button on the picture and click ""Resize"" and you can pick the size.  There's other ways, of course (probably over 100).  For example, you could use the built-in Microsoft Paint.  You'd open the picture file, then click the Resize button on the toolbar. When you have it the size you like, just press Save (or Save-As if you want a make another copy without modifying the original.)

You will be able to connect the Blu ray player to computer and use it with Windows Media Center, however you need to install the Drivers for Blue ray device, you may download the latest drivers from the manufacturer’s website and install the same on the computer and check. You may also install the supported codec’s and check. 2.      Insert the other side of the cable into your HD TV. You can use a standard TV or computer monitor, however, the picture quality on a standard TV will not improve. The port on the TV or monitor is on the back or side of the device. Plug the cable into the slot marked ""HDMI."" Again, the HDMI cables will only go in one way.  3.      Set your TV or monitor to ""HDMI"" input channel. Insert a Blu-ray disk into your player.

A final question:- How many 4-5 stars and/or good feedback have Skype/Microsoft gained (in a percentage term - high number being good) since they implemented their new version on the Apple App Store?  I'm betting it's less than 2%.,"[1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]"
Edge is my favourite browser but i'm disappointed that I can't use it on my Windows 7 and 8.1 machines. Are there any plans to create a downloadable version of Edge that can be installed on Windows 7 and Windows 8.1?

"Hi,  When Edge was introduced for the first time, I was one of the hopefuls that one day Microsoft Edge would somehow be released for Windows 7 or Windows 8 and 8.1 as well. Unfortunately, since the Edge browser is a built-in application on the new Universal Windows Platform, it wouldn't be possible to install Edge on Windows 7.

Thanks for the reply.  I realise they do this to try to persuade people to upgrade to Windows 10.  While I do have a Windows 10 licence for both my Win 7 and Win 8.1 laptops from that free upgrade offer I have found that neither laptop is 100% compatible with Windows 10.  There is no full compatible video driver available for the Windows 7 laptop and the Windows 8 laptop can't access wifi channel 13 and has poor sound quality when using Windows 10  Because of this I find it unfair that Microsoft expects you to upgrade to windows 10 to get edge. I have also found that feedback app in windows 10 to be useless because I and many other people have reported the graphics driver problem that effects older ATI Radeon mobility graphics card and have been totally ignored.,"[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]"

If you are using the new Skype application available for Android users with Nougat 7.0 and Marshmallow 6.0 OS and for iOS users with iOS version 9 and higher, then this new feature makes it slightly easier to add the right people on Skype. This cannot be disabled since this is an integrated feature but don't worry, this doesn't really step on your privacy.   Previously, in Skype, other users had to send you a contact request and wait for you to accept it before you can talk to them, now this is no longer needed in the new Skype.

"Hi Lisa and welcome to the Skype Community!   Account closure follows a step-by-step process. If you accidentally closed your account, you can still reactivate it provided that the closure took place not longer than 60 days.  When an account has been marked for closure, there will be a 60-day waiting period before it gets completely deleted from Skype's database. During these period, you can still recover the account by logging in to cancel the closure. However, if it's been longer than 60 days, there is no option to recover it anymore.   If it has not exceeded the 60 days yet, sign in to your account and the system will cancel the closure. Everything will be just as you left it and no changes will take effect on your account.

" Hi, Jeffrey Mcvicker  To explain a different way, Skype call subscriptions cannot be shared amongst several Skype accountholders.  A subscription is dedicated to the account that the subscription was purchased on.  There is no way to share a single subscription.   Will it cover my three cell phones with Verizon?  My wife, daughter, and I have separate Skype accounts, however we are bundled together with Verizon.... Therefore, the answer to your original question is, ""No."" That your Verizon wireless plan includes three numbers is not related to, and has no connection with, any Skype accounts.  Skype does not have a ""friends and family"" feature, whereby rate plans, credit, text messaging, and call minutes can be shared in an account structure such as you, your wife, and daughter have in place with Verizon.  Some of the cellular service providers offer this, however Skype subscriptions, credit, and paid features have always been and continue to be set up for purchase and use on only one account - the account used to purchase the subscription, paid feature, or credit.

This error may occur if the Hosts file contains a static IP address.""  The same error number might occur when the Office installer tries to reach the activation server, if there is a problem with that address (not the Windows Update site). It's worth checking the reason given in the article (a static IP address in the Hosts file). There are instructions in the Resolution section, under the 0x80072EE7 error code heading, for how to find and read the file. Except in very unusual circumstances, every line in the file can be commented out by putting a # character at the left margin.  A static IP address isn't the only possibility. It's also possible that during the installation/activation you don't have a working Internet connection, or that you don't have access to a Domain Name Service (DNS) server, or (unlikely) that the DNS has a bad address for Microsoft.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]"

Well mine had the same problem that vertical scroll was not working:  Fix: The mouse had so much rubbish in it that the laser counting the wheel clicks lost connection. Meaning - You have to open the mouse up and pick out all the hairs and dust balls in it and it works like new.   Basically you need a thin plastic tool or anything pointy to remove the top cover of the mouse and a set of Torx 8 screwdrivers to finish the job. Remove the rubbish with tweezers and put back together.

"Skype Thinks I Need Parental Consent  I have been using Skype on my other laptop computer for many years without issue.   This morning it asked me to sign in on my new laptop, so I did and then it asked for my birthday.  I entered the year incorrectly.  Now Skype wants me to get a parent to allow me to use it.  I went to the site it suggested account.microsoft.com and tried to add myself as a family member, but it says I already am a family member and there are no others. I updated my birthday in the Profile and that worked.  I tried logging in again, no luck. I googled the problem and see that I am not alone! So, I'm trying here.

Next step:  Go to File | Account and opt in to the Insider program, which allows you to receive new features early on, before they're more generally released; I'm fairly sure that 3D options are not yet generally out there.  Then force PowerPoint to update.  You may need to do this a time or three, quitting and restarting it in between.  That's what it took to get 3D and some of the other newer features to appear here.

"As a Word for Mac 2016 user I recently upgraded to the new High Sierra OS. Unfortunately it is raising havoc with my fonts.  Here is the problem. As a writer I have used Times New Roman as my default font for years. I have always used it with curly quotes as that is what my editors prefer. Recently, a strange thing has been happening with Times New Roman curly quotes and some other punctuation marks. Instead of producing them in Times, the document automatically changes the quotation mark font to Helvetica. That then changes the following text to Helvetica as well. If I turn off curly quotes and use only straight quotes the problem goes away. As an experiment I tried using other serif fonts with curly quotes. They also automatically convert to Helvetica. With one exception: Garamond.  This quotation mark issue raised havoc with my 700 page book manuscript, causing me to have to go through it line by line to fix the quotes. Search and replace does not really help since when it adds Helvetica it converts blocks of text after that. Right now as I stare at a deadline, my only option is to convert the entire manuscript to Garamond and forget any idea of ever using Times again. That is not an acceptable solution. S0...How do I get Times New Roman to work WITH curly quotes?  I have wasted too many hours trying to find a solution to this and have found nothing. All instances I have found have essentially given up and just quit using Times.  Given that the issue began with the switch to High Sierra I am wondering if this is an Apple issue? Or, is Microsoft not prepared to deal with High Sierra?  Thanks for listening.","[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]"

I know how to use the menu in the way you've shown, to select a certain size range overall for ALL THE DIFFERENT images displayed. What I'm talking about specifically is the ability to get multiple size choices for the SAME image., and it's one of the image searching features that puts Bing head and shoulders above Google, IMHO.  I'm an almost daily contributor to  Fark.com. I search the internet for funny pictures in a variety of topics and post them there. I prefer pictures in a sort of ""Goldilocks"" range: nothing that's too big, and nothing that's too small. This is where this now-broken feature comes in handy.  To illustrate further, and expand on the images I posted above, please compare this image with the first image I posted:    If you look carefully, you'll notice that the underlined image size in the first image above is grayed out, while the one in this image is brighter, indicating an active link. As I mentioned, if I time it right, I can click on that link if I do it within a second after refreshing the page, after which point the link grays out and goes dead.  That link leads to:    A page with multiple copies of the same image, all from different sources, with the larger sizes arrayed at the top of the page, ranging all the way down ...    ... to the smaller sizes at the bottom of the page. Yeah, I can still access it, but I have to be quick and click on that link in the first second after refreshing the page, and it doesn't always work. This is NOT the way it is supposed to work, and not the way it has worked for as long as I've been using Bing.  Additionally, the second picture I posted in my original post, there are three boxes marked ""Large"", ""Medium"" and ""Small"", plus a fourth link that says ""Search all sizes"". These links are still highlighted like the function, but they always lead to a dead page that says ""We did not find any results for ..."", and these are pictures that ALWAYS have other results.  No amount of quick-fingered clicking will make these links function like they should.  This has been an incredibly useful feature to me, and it's now broken. It doesn't work in Firefox or Internet Explorer on my computer, and I checked a friend's computer and it doesn't work in IE or Google Chrome on theirs. I think if you tried it on yours that you'd find it doesn't work like it's supposed to in Edge either.  This is a function I've been using for quite a long time, and I can say without hesitation that it is broken, and the fault is with Bing, not with my computer, as I've checked another computer and got the same results.

"Hi,   Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.   I can imagine the inconvenience you are experiencing and will certainly help you in the right direction to fix the issue. However, I would appreciate if you could answer a few questions to narrow down the issue in order to provide you with better assistance.   As per the issue description the space of your HDD get used up and no free space remains there even though you have limited apps installed. So, it seems that the issue is related to the HDD. I would suggest you to try the steps provided below and see if it helps you to fix the issue.    Method 1:  Step 1: Run Disk Clean Up  First, I suggest you to run Windows Disk Cleanup tool to clean your hard disk from all unnecessary files that might be causing this issue on your computer.  You may refer the steps in the article below to run disk clean up: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/delete-files-using-disk-cleanup#delete-files-using-disk-cleanup=windows-8  Step 2: Perform disk check  After successfully running Disk Cleanup tool, also run Check Disk to check the hard disk for errors if any and automatically repair them.    NOTE: The root drive has to be C: and the command may schedule a task at the system startup, if it does, then press Y to schedule a task and restart the computer to perform chkdsk.  Important:While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost  Method 2:Run Memory Diagnostics  I would also suggest you to run Windows Memory Diagnostics utility. Windows 8.1 includes built-in features to help you identify and diagnose problems with memory. Refer to the steps below: Method 3: Run a Malware Scan  The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software. Kindly follow the below steps to run the  Microsoft safety scanner. Important:Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.  Note: The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.  Hope this will fix the issue, if not let us know with the updated status and we will be happy to assist you further.  Regards,","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]"

"I recently contacted the help desk for Office 2016 for the Mac about changing the font sizes in the Navigation Pane and in the Comment balloons. I could not figure out a way to do this from within the Navigation Pane or the Review menu.  I tried several levels of Microsoft Support but we couldn’t make it work. After hanging up, I kept trying for a while and here’s is what finally worked:  Navigation Pane:  Have the Navigation Pane open. Select Format/Styles from the Word menu. Choose “Document Map” style under the Styles pull-down menu. Choose the styles/fonts/sizes that you want. Click Apply.  Comment Balloons:  Have comment balloons displayed and then highlight some text from any comment. Select Format/Styles from the Word menu. Choose the ‘Comment Text’ style. Make your changes and then click Apply. This is new to me but it seems to work every time. I would appreciate seeing if others can validate this approach.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

The one point that differs is that it is not necessary to open the Navigation Pane or have any Comments in a document in order to modify the Styles which determine their formatting. The Styles can be modified at any time, including when you start in a new blank document. It's just that the Styles are a bit easier to locate if they are in use. If not currently in use you have to select All Styles in the dialog window, then find those you want in a rather lengthy list.","[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]"

"I want to create the effect of a slow drip using animation in PowerPoint. I need it to repeat until I advance to the next slide. I have five droplets evenly spaced in a vertical line. Each fades in and then out, in order, making it look like the same drop is slowing moving down the line. What I can't figure out is how to have that animation repeat until I click away from the slide. The ""Repeat"" function is only applied to individual animations, not to the entire set of animations as a whole. How can I get the fade in/fade out fade in/fade out fade in/fade out etc. effect to continue repeating itself on a loop from the beginning? Counting on you geniuses to be way more clever than I am.

The only way to do this as you want is to construct your own custom custom animation. This is clearly not a trivial task.  If you download this demo I have created the five animations and you MIGHT be able to use the animation painter to apply each animation to the drops in turn.  The animation is specific to having exactly five drops! Do not try to change the timings.,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"Hi Carlos,   Thank you for getting back to us.  Zooming out of the screen to see the entire image depends on your camera's aperture. An iPhone device is averaging from f/1.45 to f/2.2 sensor. Due to the smaller sensor the iPhone lens has a much smaller field of view compared to its focal length, hence the range of angles the physical aperture has to be visible from is much reduced.

The label itself does include the colon, but that just indicates that what proceeds it on the command line is a label, it's not part of the label.  I also just, if you already haven't done it is to put an Option Explicit statement at the start of the module where the subroutine for this code resides. It will then require that all variable you use be declared. I mention it because I don't know what type of variable ""sentence"" refers to and statements like sentence.range are not valid.

So after the *first* error, control passes to the ""hey"". Then the error handler is active. So although the Next/For, the j=j+1 and On Error Got hey are executed with error, VBA is still in an active error handler when it next executes the ""third_word(j) = sentence.Range.Words(3)"", and at that point it gives up and displays the error.

Hi absurd. You make a new app with less functionality  than the old one. Then you tell people to use their desktop.  no. Actually I want to use my mobile with the app as it was able to send sms.

I tried to make the Skype test call, and it just rings and rings until I hang up.  He can Skype with others no problem, so I know this is on my end.

"Hi Brianna,  Thank you for getting back to us. Let me do my best to answer your questions.  Q: Will deleting all of these Skype files also delete my Skype contacts?

"All my contacts where showing up as offline and thus I couldn't call nor answer a contact who was waiting. Then when I went into email, (I had in the interim updated my version of Skype) that contact came up as calling, but there was a message about a google chrome extension and then an App I had to ad. Anyway without noting too much of the detail around that, as I didn't want to keep the person waiting any longer, I added all of that and I could accept the call, but afterward in my skype account (accessible through icon on desktop) there is no record of the call. But there is a vertical rectangluar window for skype on the right side of my hotmail inbox page. This features none of my old skype contacts but some new ones. In summary, how do I now access a functioning version of Skype? It now appears to be more directly linked to hotmail/outlook and the old icon and contacts no longer seem accessible or functional.

"Hello Holly,  Welcome to Skype Community!  Dial pad cannot be disabled. This is a default interface of the Skype application and it cannot be removed from the application.   The quickest way to close Skype is to right-click the Skype icon displayed in the system tray at the bottom right of the screen or the Skype icon from your menu bar, and select Quit.   And it is unusual that your presence status is not appearing correctly on your contacts' end. If that's the case, we advise you to make sure the application is up-to-date. We also advise for you to click a contact, type /msnp24 on your chat box with the contact and click Enter. This will help in refreshing your presence status on Skype.

"Hello JesseSpiritzZ,     Welcome to the Skype Community forum!   Please be advised that the computer or device that’s hosting the group call is required to have enough processing power and network bandwidth for the group call. Having many people on a call can sometimes put too much strain on the host device and cause call quality problems. To improve group call quality, make sure the host has a strong network and powerful processor, or reduce the number of people on the call.   For your information on Call quality, kindly refer to this link: Call quality guide (Windows desktop)   To troubleshoot call issues, please check this link: Troubleshooting problems with Skype calls   Should you have further queries, please do not hesitate to reply to this post.

Does this occur when they sign into skype for web or other software that utilizes skype while on a call already? I created a second account to test my theory and that seemed to be the case...

"Hello Michael,  Thank you for the response.  I definitely understand why you feel that way, but please be informed that since Skype has been acquired by Microsoft, the option to sign in to Skype using your Microsoft account is possible.  If you sign up using mobile number, your Skype name is: live(alphanumeric) called lightweight account and if you sign up using email, your Skype name is your email address. Thus, if you did not link your Skype and Microsoft account and you've signed in to Skype using your email address, Skype will create you an account with pre-determined Skype name.  You can link your Skype and Microsoft accounts to avoid the confusion from having two separate accounts. This way, you can also sign in to Skype using your email address/ Microsoft account without routing you to a different account.  I hope this information helps but if you have questions and clarifications, please do not hesitate to reply. ","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"

There's a multitude of ways contacts could have gotten into your contact list and many of those ways do not involve you manually adding them. For example, if you have an outlook.com account tied to your Skype account, your Outlook contacts might be shown in your contact list. Or if you synced your address book in the past and contacts got imported that way - the contact might have changed their display name to something unrecognizable.  We understand our users often don't like seeing these contacts in their contact list and want control over who shows up, so we're making sure some of these contacts aren't added automatically moving forward.

I wish someone was just able toggle the birthdate and have it done instead of going through all these exercises.  That being said, in an effort to correct this situation, I did the following.  I created a new Microsoft account  I attempted to authorize myself acting as my own parent for my old account. That exercise seemed to fail however today I was presented with an option to merge the two accounts. Clearly Microsoft noticed that the email address was the same on the two.  I merged the accounts and I'm now able to log in.  While I completely understand and appreciate the fact that Microsoft has to be cautious about children having access to these systems, if someone had spent about 30 seconds they would have realized the account had been active for many many years.  It was Microsoft that forced an entry of a birthdate and I made a typo I'll take the blame for that.

" I am sorry to hear that you are having issue with your Skype application for Windows 10. I will help you on that.  You, and the person you're calling should follow these steps: 1. Use the latest version of Skype. We're always improving call quality, so for best performance, make sure that you and the person you're calling are using the latest version of Skype. Download the latest version. 2. Check your connection. If your audio or video calls freeze, your video looks block-like or has motion blur, it might be your internet connection (or your friend's) causing the problem. If Skype detects a weak connection, it will reduce the quality to try and stop the call from dropping altogether. 3. Is another application interfering with your call? Close any applications that could be interfering with your call. File sharing applications, streaming audio or video, or even just having a web browser open are all things that can eat up bandwidth.

"Hi , To connect your computer to a television, your computer needs to have a video port that matches one of the inputs on your television. If your television does not have a VGA or DVI input that matches an output on your computer, you will need to use composite video or S-Video cables.  If your computer doesn't have any of these TV-compatible outputs, then you might be able to install a new video card that has the right connection. You will need a HDMI cable to connect TV with laptop. Follow these steps to connect your computer to your TV: 1. Turn off your computer and position it within easy reach of your TV. Disconnect the monitor, but leave the mouse and keyboard connected. 2. Connect the appropriate video cable from your computer's output to your TV. 3. Turn on your TV and set it to the input that matches the output on your computer. You might need to refer to the user's guide included with your TV for instructions on how to do this. 4. Turn on your computer. You should see Windows displayed on your TV. If the screen looks stretched, or part of the screen seems cut off, you probably need to adjust the screen resolution in Windows. http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Getting-the-best-display-on-your-monitor If you can't see Windows on your TV, you might need to reconnect the computer to your monitor and adjust the screen resolution before you connect to your TV. http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Connect-your-computer-to-a-TV http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/HDTV-frequently-asked-questions Check the display settings.

"Hello, Please forgive that I have asked this in another forum already, but I have received no responses there, and it has been out there for several weeks now. My hope is that maybe someone in this forum possibly has some ideas? I have been trying a few different things, and have done some research, but haven't yet found an answer to this question.  I have a total of 71 Workbooks with 2 tabs each, and they all need to be set up for printing. While I have set everything up for printing as best I could, some of them print out really small.  I'll provide an example. I've set the page breaks manually for all of these. One sheet/tab has the following:  A1:I30 that needs to print as page 1. A31:F64 needs to print as page 2. A65:F88 needs to print as page 3. A89:H135 needs to print as page 4. A136:G167 needs to print as page 5. A168:J202 needs to print as page 6. A203:I239 needs to print as page 7. A240:G264 needs to print as page 8.  Now, that's only one tab, and literally every tab has different ranges for each page.  The challenge is that when everything is adjusted to fit the largest area, the percentage shrinks for everything.  Is there a way to make each manually created page on this one tab (as described above) print as a different percentage for each manually created page? (So that each range above prints at a different percentage?) So, for example (and I'm using random percentages here for illustration purposes), if say the defined range that makes page 8 could print as 100% and fit on one page, but page 6 maybe needs to be 40% to fit on one page, and say page 2 could fit at 85% for one page, is this possible to accomplish?  Note: Everything needs to remain on the one tab.  So, right now with those above ranges for this example, all pages print at 40% when not all pages otherwise would not need to print out that small; the only reason all pages print out at 40% now is because of accomodating for the largest area (manually created page). (Note: I have also tried setting print areas manually as well and that didn't seem to make a difference.)  Thanks in advance for any assistance you can provide.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]"
"Thank you very much for the code.  I put the code in, and re-saved the document as an .xlsm. I did some test printing where I printed out the one with the code applied, and then printed the original .xlsx version to compare them side by side. Unfortunately, there is no visible difference between the two.  The smaller ""areas"" that would otherwise fit on the page at 100% are still printing out really tiny leaving a lot of white space in addition to being hard to read due to the tiny printing. I get the larger ""areas"" need to print smaller and have tiny print, but the goal is to print the smaller areas with larger print.  Also, I have used code before, and have never seen the notice from Excel that I saw with this code, and am curious as to why that may be. There was a security warning: ""Privacy warning: This document contains macros, ActiveX controls, XML expansion pack information, or Web components. These may include personal information that cannot be removed by the Document Inspector.""  These documents will be widely distributed to users who do not know how to use Excel all that well and that warning going out with them is not something that would work well.  I did also Reset all of the page breaks just to see if that would make a difference in allowing the code to sort of ""take over"", and that did not work either.  I appreciate your assistance and effort.","[0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]"

"Thank you both very, very much for the different codes.  I have tried all of them as best I could. I used all 4 codes with the original page breaks in place. I used all 4 codes after re-setting page breaks, and then setting print areas. I used all 4 codes after re-setting page breaks completely.  Unfortunately, none of this worked.  With the last 2 codes, the array formula was red (error) with the two ((, so I removed one to make it (, and the red line (error) went away.

(and there is an extra left paren which you have correctly removed).  These will be the pages if the Zoom settings are set to fit that area on a single page.  Then each of the codes has the command  ...PrintArea = where it passes the address of the range for the specific area being printed.   You should remove all manual pagebreaks because scaling does not override pagebreaks like Fit to page does.  To summarize -   no manual page breaks   no printareas defined.    Put percent scaling into the arrays to correspond to the range areas - determined by doing it manually first (but if you can't see the page data doing it manually, then using the same scaling with the code will be no better.   -- Regards, Trevor Ogilvy    ","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"Hi Trevor I got to this post because I am trying to combine 2 tabs to print with different scaling; what differs from the case above is that the range of data in the first tab varies according to different parameters (via a macro). So I cannot put in already a set zoom degree, because the range needs to be according to the populated rows of the tab (which I guess I can do with some counta function?).

For instance: where are... ... all my non-skype contacts? ... the tools to call a number in my iphone contacts? ... my basic status as online, busy, invisible?

I have the same concern and would like to say skype was better than all others and we have been using skype for its uniqueness and i do not prefer the new skype where it looks so similar to othr social network apps and skype was used by many becoz of its uniqueness and i my self will find another app too if you guys dont give us back our old skype . And the video staying on screen when texting is so annoying on phone where sometimes we want to hide that we are in video call too and pretend that we are on a texting screen plz bring old skype back without being too open like othr apps which are already in the market.

"Hi, I have just noticed that my phone automatically updated my mobil Skype app. I have everything about it and wish I can revert. The new version is completely useless to me in its current form. the problem I have with it is that people who i have been connected with for 15 years can't reach me on my mobil iPhone. Their calls are now only being received by Mac Book Pro lap top. Although the previous updates at least kept the app operational, although worse with each update, nothings don't work at all. Everything has been wiped out without my consent, besides my ID, login and password; even my profile picture. But the worse is that i can find access to my contact list I had there for the last 15 years, they are not the same contacts that are in my US phone book, they are all overseas and their information was only available on Skype. In all previous versions it remained intact and intuitive. how horrible is the app design if you have to do a research on how to access your own data on the account. if it is even there. Synching my phone contacts doesn't do any good in my situation, My notebook still has the old version, which may help in some data recovery, But how am i supposed to reenter it into a new app? how am i supposed to connect to people who were always in my Skype connected with me, but were never entered in my phone because there was never a need for it. phone list was for - phone call people , and Skype was to call people overseas who don't have access to international phone lines, or wi-fi strictly mobil apps like WhatsApp And Viber. or older generation who can handle a desktop version but doesn't have access to mobil.. the whole point of having Skype Mobil was to not have to lag a laptop around and have Skype in my phone to talk to my parents and grandparents overseas being available to them 24/7 with the new upgrade i don't even see how this can still work and continue to be useful. if there is no remedy and reinstalling my old contact list, there is no point for me to keep or use this mobil app version of Skype.

"I'm looking to do a little media distribution in my house and believe the Windows 7 will give me the ability to do what I want, but I'm not sure whether I want to use media center or media player or some combo of the two. Here's what I want to do.  I have my media sitting on a windows home server and I want to play it in another room of my house. One option is to use another PC with media center at the place where I want to play it and let that run through the TV, but I really hate the idea of being forced to turn my TV on just to pick what music I want to listen to, this seems overkill. So what I had in mind was a PC with a touch screen that I could wall mount. This would allow me to browse media using the touch interface. The next thing becomes how to control the media from other places in the house. What I really like is the ability in media player to do the ""Play To"" thing, this is great, because I could if I wanted to keep the PC that's close to the amp and TV headless with no display and use 'Play to' to control it from any other PC in the house. My only problem is that then I loose the 10 ft interface of media center.  Any thoughts on being able to do a remote media center session from any other PC, so I'd like to be able to mount a big 20"" touchscreen PC (like an HP Touchsmart) on the wall in my kitchen and use the touch interface to control the media center by the TV. If I could do this from any PC, then I could in theory do this from any PC device in the house.  Thoughts on how I could pull this off would be welcome.  thanks.","[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

However, I am afraid to tell you that the only other way to use Skype on your Mac is to update it to at least Mac OS X 10.9 or higher.

We want to create the best possible app experience for our Skype users which means we have to make some changes along the way.

"From what I can understand, it sounds like all is working as expected...  #3: That's correct. The Find dialog is modal, so nothing can be done in the worksheet as long as it is displayed. However, if a found instance is located outside the current viewing area the sheet will scroll automatically in order to display that instance.  #1: I'm not sure what you mean by ""top search bar"": There are 2 possibilities;  Using Find & Replace does move the cell selector from one found instance to the next, but it does not cause the reference in the Name Box to change with each move. When the dialog window is closed, the reference in the Name Box updates based on the currently selected cell.  The Search Sheet control is not directly associated with Excel's Find & Replace feature. If using that, the reference in the Name Box does update each time the ◀︎▶︎ are used to move to the next found instance.  #2: I'm afraid I have no idea what you mean by ""cell number in the left margin"".

The processor is an NVIDIA TEGRA 3 Quad Core CPU at 1.30 GHz, with RAM of 2.00 GB, a 32-bit OS, ARM based processor. The tablet has been completely updated with all updates from Microsoft after determined by running a scan and has little to no used space as all storage is to flash sticks.

"Hi Crystal: My name is Ron. Yes your question does make sense. It is a good idea to re-install Windows on a ""new used"" computer that you get from someone else. Re-installing Windows wipes out all of their files, any potential malware they may have picked up and it gets rid of any software they installed that you don't need. Before you do it, it is always a good idea to backup the data files at the very least to some other location. Better yet, it is a good idea to make an ""Image copy"" backup so that you have a ""known good"" point to restore to if you run into problems doing the windows install. Sorry, there is very little chance you can transfer your copy of Windows 8 to this computer. If Windows 8 came with the other computer, you simply cannot transfer it. What you can most likely do is use the build in ""recovery"" feature to reset your computer to ""factory fresh"". This short How to Video is pretty good: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA1LSmLwEfI NOTE: if you have any programs instaled you want to keep, ie Office, you need to make sure you have the ""Product Key"" or ""serial number"" you need to reintall those applications. As well you'll need the install files or disk. You can download up to Office 2007 from MS, other applications you'll have to check to see what they say. *********** If you find a reply has fixed your problem please click on the ""Accept this answer"" blue hyperlink button.

"Hi , this is Sarah from the Microsoft Community. Lets see if we can get your problem resolved. Since the computer already comes with a valid license for Windows 7, I would just perform a factory reset and set it up with a new user account. New computers that come preinstalled with Windows often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to boot into when you start your computer by pressing a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9, F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key. Consult the owners manual that came with your PC for instructions about how to reinstall Windows. This is how the recovery partition is accessed for the most popular makes.. For Dell, press CTRL + F11 directly after powering up the unit For HP, press F11 directly after powering up the unit For LG, press F11 directly after powering up the unit For Toshiba, press and hold '0' BEFORE and during the power up For Acer, press and hold ALT + F10 as soon as you see the logo For Asus, press F9 as soon as you see the Asus logo. For Samsung, press F4 at power up.. For Fujitsu, press the F8 key repeatedly directly after powering up For Advent, restart your computer. Then Press F10 repeatedly until the message ""Starting System Recovery"" is displayed For Sony VAIO, restart and press ""F8"" or ""F10"" repeatedly until the ""Advanced Boot Options"" screen appears. If you want to run something newer than Windows 7, you might still be able to get Windows 10 for free: https://www.groovypost.com/howto/download-windows-10-free/ Best, AndreSarah Windows Insider MVP MVP-Windows and Devices for IT http://twitter.com/adacosta","[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]"

"Hello, I work for a company that partners with universities to create interactive course content for online degree programs. Usually, we record lectures in-studio with a full crew, but on occasion, we have to record professors or guests lecturing over Powerpoint slides remotely. For quality control reasons, these sessions need to be done live on a video call between a producer and a professor/guest. In the past, we've had no problem using Skype (7.44) with Call Recorder (2.6.2) to output two separate files: – one of the professor's webcam, and – one of the professor's screenshare (of a Powerpoint deck, for example). However, with more recent versions of Skype (specifically those rolled out in June 2017), we seem to have lost the ability to record the guest's screen and webcam simultaneously.  Is this a feature that was phased out intentionally? Is there a workaround that might be possible with newer versions of Skype? In the meantime, we have phased back to the versions that work for our needs (Skype 7.44 and Call Recorder 2.6.2), and I have reached out to support at Call Recorder to see if this is an issue on their end.

"Without any details it's hard to tell from a screen shot, but my guess is that the image was inserted & Scaled to fit the Slide Size at the time. The Slide Size then was changed to A3, in which case there was a prompt about ""Scaling"" the image & Yes was selected.  The program did exactly what it was supposed to do. The reason for the ""straps"" is that the original Slide Size & A3 have different aspect ratios. The result is that the image was scaled but was scaled proportionately in order to avoid distortion... That's why it spans the width but not the height of the slide.  In these examples the slide on the left illustrates the image scaled to fit the default Widescreen size, the slide on the right is the same slide after changing to A3:    IOW, changing the slide size after adding content is like having a custom tailored suit made, then gaining/losing 25 pounds & growing 3 inches taller.

"When I'm going through a large word document inserting headers, any text that is formatted into multiple columns (and all the text below it) does not minimize under the corresponding header. Text that isn't formatted into multiple columns minimizes just fine, but as soon as I format a chunk of text into multiple columns, those columns and any text below them no longer minimize properly (until I get to the next header, at which point the issue is ""reset"" until I use column formatting agaim).  Here is a photo to illustrate my problem:   I'm running Windows 10 and have an Office 365 home subscription. Is this a feature that's supposed to be there? Or is this an issue I can fix?

"You aren't going to be able to do what you want. The reason is that there is a section break between the heading and the multi-column text, which is required in order to change the number of columns.  The collapse mechanism is built to collapse anything from the heading down to -- but not including -- the next heading of the same outline level or the next section break.  If the heading comes after the section break (that is, it's part of the multi-column section), then collapsing the heading will collapse the text below it -- again, down to the next heading of the same level or the next section break.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Thank you so much - I've been trying to get a straightforward answer on this issue for a week now, and you've given it to me. I'm guessing there's no workaround that exists to make it so that the transition from normal text to columns isn't registered as a section break? ","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"There are a couple of possibilities, but they'll involve additional fiddling with the text if you need to edit it.  One way is to replace the two-column section (and the section breaks at its beginning and end) with a two-column-one-row table and turn off its borders. You'll then have to manually move text (and any images) from the end of the first column to the second column to balance the column lengths. If you later add or remove anything in the table, you'll have to manually rebalance the columns.  Another way is to use two side-by-side text boxes. Use the Size settings on the Drawing Tools tab to make them the same size. To ensure that the text boxes stay where you want them, click Drawing Tools > Position > More Layout Options and set the first box to ""Left relative to Column"" and the second box ""Right relative to Column"", both of them ""Top relative to Margin"". Click in the left box and click the Create Link button on the Drawing Tools tab, and then click in the right box -- now text will ""flow"" from the left box to the right box. (Note that the boxes don't automatically resize when the text exceeds their total length -- another manual adjustment. They also don't continue to the next page; you'd have to draw another pair of text boxes and link from box 2 to box 3 and then from box 3 to box 4. There's a maximum of 32 linked boxes.)","[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]"

"So about a month ago my legacy Skype iOS version I'm using logged out and never logged back in, ""can't connect to skype"" being the error message (posted on here). The issue, I presume, is due to something server-side being taken down, while it is still hardcoded in the config of this legacy version (4.17.135).  Interestingly, a 4.18.15 (/ 8.1.0.47312) Skype build (iPad targeted, I believe, but has iPhone assets and works on iPhone) logs in as normal.  I figured if I could transfer the config from the iPad/working version, I can continue using 4.17.135. So far, the main (or so I thought) changes I spotted were in (primary)server in the per-account config.xml (s.gateway.messenger.live.com instead of bn2-s.gateway.messenger.live.com in 4.17.135), updout and SuperNode in shared.xml. However, inserting new values didn't do the trick. Surprisingly, just copying the <Credentials3> string from the account-specific config.xml of 4.18.15 logs you in automatically (due to the Default string in the config I guess), but if you log out it's the same error all over again and the string is removed, so a one-time solution.

Hi The standard procedure for changing language is to go to the menu -> tools -> change language : https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA73/how-do-i-change-the-language-used-by-skype-for-windows-desktop The problem is that there is no menu (at the top left of the window) at all in my Win10 Skype App -> therefore I cannot make any changes. Settings do not offer any option for changing language neither. I am based in the UK - but would like to operate different language than default English. Help will be very appreciated.

"In my organization, we have a Word document that has a editable table.  It has become uneditable, and the only way to fix it would be to uninstall Office and then reinstall it.

I wish to save a backup copy of XL files (to the same folder on C drive as the base file) when I do an update thereto and save the file. I am not referring to Autosave. ,"[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]"
"When you say not referring to Autosave"" I am not sure if you mean the Auto Recover or AutoBackup. There is a description of AutoBackup at the following link. (Go down towards the end of the page under heading ""AutoBackup"")    https://www.online-tech-tips.com/ms-office-tips/excel-autorecover-and-automatic-backup/  However, the above method overwrites the previous backups and if this is not what you require and you want to keep several versions of backups then you will need to change the document to a Macro Enabled Workbook and use the Save Event VBA code below.   To install the VBA Event code:  Now when the workbook is saved, if changes have been made since opening,  then a backup file will be created in the same folder as the master. If no changes then the file will save as normal but no backup will be created. The backup File Name is in the format  Filename yyyy-mm-dd hh mm ss.xlsm The reverse date with year first is used so the file names can be sorted. All 2 digit months, days, hours, minutes and seconds are used because sorting is based on text and this ensures that sorting occurs correctly.  If the User selects ""Save As"" then the backup code is not implemented and allows the user to create a file name of choice. ie the user might select a backup version and the use Save As to replace the master copy.  Feel free to get back to me if any problems.   Copy all of the code below into the VBA editor.   Private Sub Workbook_BeforeSave(ByVal SaveAsUI As Boolean, Cancel As Boolean)         Dim strBackupName As String         'If user selects ""Save As"" then the code for backup does not run so that user     'can select a backup and then save to whatever name is required     If SaveAsUI = False Then         'Only run backup code if change made.

"I was using another VOiP service on my Mac laptop (Ucallweconn) but it seems to have gone out of business (taking a small amount of my credit with it). I already use Skype for computer-to-computer video calls so thought I'd try the VOiP service and bought £10 credit (UK). I followed all the instructions but every call I try to call a landline or mobile in the UK or France it ends in less than a second and says ""no reply"". Anyone found the answer to this kind of problem? Thanks PS: I thought Skype was supposed to have a live chat support? When I follow the instructions for that it just brings me to this community.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"Helpful link, thanks.  Unfortunately I cannot give you the whole picture, or even anything like the whole picture, but some things to look out for:  a. the Sharepoint data types do not map all that well onto the Word content control types. (There are a lot more of the former, for one thing).  b. Some of the mapping, in particular the presentation choices, used to be better when the old Document Information Panel (DIP) was available, in the sense that the display *in the DIP* conformed better to the data type in Sharepoint. But I do not think for example you can present a multiple choice as a set of radio buttons in Word.  c. As far as I know, the current version of Word Online lets you see content controls (and even the content control Name tags) but does not let you edit their contents. I think you have to use an Office (Javascript) Add-in to do that. However, even that may depend on whether you are using the ""public"" version of Word Online or one hosted by a private SharePoint site, although I assume that the latter version always catches up to the former .  d. When you edit in Desktop Word, what Word actually looks at to try to validate the data in a content control is the XML schema that is generated by SharePoint and inserted along with the Server metadata. But the user does not necessarily get to see that they have invalid data until they click outside the control or try to save. But some of the constraints that you might think would be applied are not - for example, if you specify a multiline type in SharePoint, you can specify a maximum line count, and AFAIK you do not get to specify a character count limit. But when you enter a new line in a plain text content control in Word, what Word inserts is a hard line return, and the resulting lines do not appear to count as lines as far as SharePoint is concerned. Further, Word seems to impose a 255 character maximum whatever SharePoint allows.  e. Because the Word checkbox content control type was not one of the original types, SharePoint does not use it. (Although I think perhaps it should, now). So the obvious user interface element for Yes/No type values is not used. Instead, you get a dropdown that presents ""true"" and ""false"" choices, and theya re literally those choices because that's what gets sent in the XML.  f. As a general rule, indexed types are probably not going to work as you might like. e.g. a Lookup just presents a number, not the text actually referenced by the lookup. And I don't think stuff such as Person/Group or Managed MetaData types will work properly. **EDIT: At least some of the stuff that you used to be able to do in the DIP you can now do in BackStage in the Property editing area. In fact some of it is better in thte sense that you do get to see lookups etc. from SharePoint.","[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]"

"<<  Do you know if this has been reported as faults to Microsoft using a Microsoft Premier Support agreement. >>  No, I don't.  Although I sometimes report things through the mechanisms available to me, I'm not a company paying a lot for support, and my personal experience of almost all avenues to Microsoft support was almost always very, very bad, so I try to spend as little time as possible interacting with any of them. Part of the problem is that when there is no response from them, you cannot even tell whether a problem has already been discovered or reported. It wastes everyone's time, not just theirs. I generally only report stuff that appears to have changed accidentally or which looks to me as if it is not going to require a major effort. To be honest it would surprise me if such the various shortcomings to do with controls/SharePoint had not been reported by people who use that stuff day in, day out - there certainly seems to have been an outcry when InfoPath was deprecated.  Some of the problems might be perceived as design faults, but I think in many cases it is probably more to do with the fact that the Word team introduced content controls at a certain point in SharePoint's development and there has been some ossification.  OTOH if you have a good experience of Microsoft support, it may be worth your while reporting stuff that you come across that doesn't work as you might expect!  ","[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]"

I have a table with multiple columns, each of which contains a list of selected integers between 1 and 340.

I want to copy the value in each cell of the column to a new column, but with the row number defined by the value in that column. (Only alternate columns A, C, E are filled, leaving B, D, F etc. for the returned results). So, for example, if the first three cells A1, A2, A3 in column A contain the values 83, 41, 279, I want the formula to return the values 83, 41, 279 into cells B83, B41 and B279 respectively. It doesn't matte that the intervening cells will be blank.

"Hi Kristin,   Although you need to do what follows to deal with the infection (and you are most certainly infected), and while this is no guarantee and usually used for a more widespread hidden file problem, the following Unhide program may solve the immediate problem concerning hidden files you raise in your post: http://download.bleepingcomputer.com/grinler/unhide.exe.  But that's by no means the end of it and please don't stop there even if it works because that's just one of the more obvious tips of the iceberg and we need to deal with the infection itself to resolve this properly.   Another common trick to block internet access can sometimes be resolved as follows: Restore Internet Connection: Open IE, Tools, Internet Options, Connections, LAN Settings, uncheck “Use Proxy Server.”  As with the above, even if this works, we are still far from done.  We've just possibly resolved some of the obvious symtoms but must still remove the infection.   Whether or not those worked, try the following (in Safe Mode with Networking if that helps).  If you're stuck, skip to the bold part and just get expert help (which is what I honestly recommend as what you should do in any case as it is safer, faster, easier, and more certain to resolve the problem and have it verified by specialists in malware-removal so you can be more comfortable that the problem (and maybe others as well) has truly been resolved).  The problem here is that you are infected by a Rogue virus and while standard recovery techniques sometimes will help, you really need to deal with the infection and not just the consequences of the infection - though we may need to deal with them as well later if fixing the source of the problem doesn't do so (or the experts you get to help you don't also assist you with that as well).   First, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:http://www.malwarebytes.org/ and SuperAntiSpyware:http://superantispyware.com/ and then run a full ESET online scan: http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner. These may or may not remove the infections, but will probably not repair any damage caused by them. Even if they or your current AV software seem to work or indicate you aren't infected, you shouldn't completely trust them and need to continue with the recommendations that follow (so it's up to you if you want to try them first or just skip over all of this and get the expert help you really need as described below).   Properly and completely removing such infections can be complex and often require manual removal procedures (which may or may not be entirely effective either). Even if they work, I'd suggest the following anyway, so we may as well start there (you can ignore the above removal methods if you want as this is really the way to go, but it won't hurt to try them).

First is the page size.  It opens as A4 size instead of Letter size.  Bizarre. Second, why do the headers and page numbers disappear?  Inexplicable. Third is the endnote marker.  They were all set to superscript in a small font.  Reopening, they are now Tahoma size 11, without superscript.  If I can't change them all, doing them individually may take as much as three hours (it did Saturday).  Why has the format changed?  Checking the format of a couple of these now wrongly formatted superscript markers, I see they are also marked as +Body.  That is a theme.  If I knew how to change the settings for +Body, I could perhaps simply change that to fix the endnote markers all at once.  How do I change +Body?

"Hi My system is as follows: * Nokia Lumia 2520 (note, this is a tablet, not a mobile phone) * Windows RT I have the above tablet and purchased the keyboard to accompany it; the keyboard incidentally has a battery which complements the main battery in the tablet.  Prior to a recent full system refresh, the battery meter displayed both on the Windows 8 interface, but also in the notification area of the desktop recognised and displayed both batteries and gave a sensible total percentage charge.  For example, when both the tablet and keyboard batteries are quite fully charged, the overall charge is displayed as 100% or slightly less. However, since the full system refresh, the overall charge percentage is making little sense.  For example, at the current time, charge percentages are as follows: * Tablet battery: 100% * Keyboard battery: 1% * Overall charge: 13% I am aware that the tablet battery provides significantly more battery time than the keyboard battery and so am confused as to why the overall charge displayed is so low. Prior to the full system refresh, I am very sure that in the scenario above for the tablet and keyboard battery charges, the overall charge would have more logically been far higher, perhaps at least 80%. I did notice that the overall charge status in terms of 'plugged in/ charging/ not charging' seems to report the status of the keyboard battery, rather than the tablet battery and wonder if the battery meter is somehow inappropriately prioritising the keyboard battery, which is essentially a 'slave' battery. Would anybody therefore know why the above would be occurring and also perhaps how Windows RT tends to handle dual batteries? I can confirm that as of 19/01/16, system update confirms the tablet is fully up to date, so I would assume that any previous fixes that may have been implemented are already installed. Thank you for your time. Best regards Kim","[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]"

"Hi Brian  Thank you for your reply.  I ran the troubleshooter in step one, but the only problem that this identified was that the display was set too bright and which was automatically fixed.  I then used the commands in step two, which both ran in the command prompt successfully.  However, this does not appear to have affected the behaviour of the power meter.  I have noticed that despite the tablet being on charge for more than one hour, the keyboard battery charge has only moved from 6% to 7% in that time, which from my experience of how this previously charged, would be a very slow charging time.  I have also realised that despite the battery meter identifying that the keyboard battery is 'plugged in' and 'charging', the AC adapter that plugs into the mains electrical socket is cold, which would perhaps indicate that no actual charging is taking place.  However, the tablet battery is able to charge and charges quickly and fully.  TheEvan keyboard itself in little more than one year old and has not been used to excess, with it likely only having been charged a relatively small number of times.  I would therefore be surprised if the battery had failed.  Is it possible that in reality both batteries are fully charged, as evidenced by the cold AC adapter and that battery meter is displaying inaccurate information?

"So I have an excel document that has 100+ worksheets in it. We use this to list all of the various materials that we need to purchase for a project. For example, if we are using 5 different sizes of screws, we would list all of these out and then have a total quantity needed cell beside it.  Most of these sheets are identically set up in the same manner, with the exception that the name of the sheet is different and the various quantities will vary on each sheet. On our main page (Master BOM), we type out all of the different items and then we go onto the various worksheets (UNIT NAMES) that use those products. On these pages we type the quantity we need and we have it set up to where all of these sheet quantities are totaled on the Master BOM sheet. What I am now trying to do is create another sheet that lists the names of all of the worksheets and then beside these names list the total number of units being made. For example, if we are building 3 different sized boxes named Box A, Box B, and Box C, and we are ordering 2,4, & 6, respectively, I have a cell labeled Box A and the cell beside it has a quantity of 2 in it. Make sense? So I have my list completely done and the quantities listed beside them. What I am needing to do is have that corresponding quantity automatically link to the worksheet for that particular unit. So using my example above, I have Box A listed with 2 quantities. I want that 2 (or whatever number I have to update it to) to automatically link to the worksheet that I have for Box A (and yes the worksheet is labeled as Box A already). Is there a way to do this without me having to go through every single sheet and type that it is equal to a certain cell? I do have Kutools if that helps.","[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"I've read through previous posts regarding LiveWeb and anomalies when using PowerPoint 2013/2016. I'll first say, I appreciate the work of Lisa Pillai for providing a solution that fills a gap of PowerPoint and a thank you to him for providing a free tool. It's been helpful to me with legacy versions of PowerPoint and works great. To be specific, the posts/threads/sites I have read through are: ""LiveWeb in PowerPoint"" - https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_powerpoint-mso_winother/liveweb-in-powerpoint-2016/5c883360-cecc-4a67-8f11-b22be06a4db8 vanderBlog: Realtime Webpages - https://vdpluijm.blogspot.com/2014/01/real-time-webpages-in-powerpoint-2013.html LiveWeb FAQ's from Mr. Pillai - http://skp.mvps.org/livewebfaq.htm I have the add-in 'working' without errors for ActiveX or Macros by changing the respective registry entries for my Office 2016 .msi installation on one box and the ClickToRun installation on a 2nd box.  I have attempted a few different browser emulation modes after beginning with the defaults from the LiveWeb FAQ page. Here's the issue I am having: When I visit the slide with the LiveWeb control the very FIRST time the slide ONLY displays a blank page.  If I arrow back one page or use a hyperlink back to another page and then return to the LiveWeb slide I see the embedded webpage as desired.  Once I close the presentation and open it again I have to visit the page once (getting the blank page) then go to another slide and then come back in order  for the page to be displayed and continues to display until I close the presentation and open it again. Testing I have tested on two different machines and multiple profiles to attempt to eliminate any local issues.  I have used both the LiveWeb.exe install process and the ppam add-in steps during my testing. My configuration is: Win10 1703 (Creators Update) Office 2016 .msi  (although I have the same outcome on ClickToRun Machine) patched to July and then August 2017 with Office updates Default MS Edge Browser (I have also set IE as the default during testing) I have tested PowerPoint in Kiosk Mode (the one I'd like to use with the add-in) as well as standard ""presented by speaker"" mode. Both give same results. A thought or two: To add to what I am seeing, I can tell the add-in is running because when I run the presentation and hit the slide with LiveWeb control in it and it doesn't display I can ""Alt-Tab"" and see a process window running with the content.  I cannot open that window from there but it is there.  So, I know it is not being 'blocked' and I don't receive any errors.   Hopefully, I'm a little 'clearer than mudd' on explaining but glad to give more information if anyone out there has some thoughts one where I should focus my efforts. Thank you!","[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]"

I have, during troubleshooting removed all of LiveWeb components from the PowerPoint and from the OS itself.

"Hi Lisa -  Thank you for your response and input WRT LiveWeb and Win10 Creator's update.  I spent some time on it tonight and Win10 1703 Feature Update (Creators) seems to be the culprit in the scenarios I tested.  Here's some info from my trials.....  I was able to do some further troubleshooting tonight and confirmed that the issue is only experienced after the Windows 10 Creators's update. I setup two VM's  (1-Win10Pro 1607 and 1-Win10Education 1607).  I installed Office 2016 Pro Plus on both VM's and then LiveWeb with the respective registry entries modified as needed.  I then inserted a few LiveWeb slides and ran the presentation and the pages and files both were displayed on the first time through.  I then ran Windows Update on both VM's and received the needed security patches up to but before the 1703 Creator's Feature Update.  I tested again with the presentation and the pages/files displayed on the first go around.    My next update to both VM's was the Creator's Update 1703 Feature update. Once that was loaded and systems rebooted I ran the Presentations and both DID NOT display the webpage/files with LiveWeb. :-(  While not resolved as of yet, I appreciate you guiding me to focus on the Creator's Update!   I'm happy to have narrowed it down, at least in my mind to the cause and it helps me with a more concise work around for the immediate. ","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Lisa et al -  Just an update after a little more troubleshooting.  Again, I'm not a programmer and my troubleshooting is limited to more of an 'desktop' style.  This post's purpose is to sharing information for others more than anything.  So, I decided to open task manager during the running of a slide with the LiveWeb control to see if I can see any process that were running with the thought of maybe getting a Process Explorer app installed and get more granular.  Windows Task Manager looks like this when hitting the slide with LiveWeb (screen shot inserted)    You'll notice on the third process under Microsoft PowerPoint (32 bit) (3) a process that just shows a ""Window Icon"" but does not provide any text to indicate what it is.  That line and icon do indeed represent the LiveWeb control. This (as stated in initial post) confirms the add-in is running correct and not erroring or being blocked.  In TaskManager if you right-click that Window Icon and choose ""Bring to Front"" while on the first pass of viewing that slide the contents display (so a second visit is not needed).   Of course, this cannot be done or would not be effective while running the PowerPoint presentation.  In my layman's terms, I believe maybe the embedded control is loosing top window focus and therefore is not seen on the first visit to the slide.  I just don't understand why if you go back (or forward) and then revisit the slide a 2nd time it THEN puts that window in the front.  WORKAROUND IN PLACE Again, just sharing information that I am seeing.  My work around has been to create a custom Slide Show with only the slides that have the embedded control and let them cycle through once before the 'live' presentation begins.  I then stop the custom show (without exiting PowerPoint) and run the full show.  All of the content on LiveWeb slides displays perfectly.  I am using the add-in unlike most;  the LiveWeb control is used on 70 different slides to show individual PDF or PNG files. LiveWeb has been a HUGE help to us. I know most others would use it on one possibly two slides in a presentation.  Hats off to ShyamLisa!","[1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]"

"I am not sure, but I suspect this is a memory issue.  Microsoft likes to add bells and whistles for the Marketing types not realizing that Excel is used by the Accounting types and we hate the bells and whistles, especially when they stop us from doing our jobs.  They also assume that each time they put out a new product your computer power X10. To find out if this is the case, we can look to see if you are doing other things using a lot of memory.  Common ones in my experience are Vlookups over a large range, conditional formatting over a large range, or a random cell like XXA876583 having a space instead of being blank, which means that not only does Excel store the space in cell XXA876583, but it stores in memory that every other cell above and left of that cell is blank (well, and it stores the data you care about too). The third is the easiest to fix and won't be a bother for you, just go to the lower right corner of your data and see if your scroll bars are at the bottom left.  If they are not, scroll left to the edge of the scroll bar, then delete all columns between where you now are and your data.  do the same thing with rows from the bottom of the scroll bar to the bottom of your data.

"God, I really wish someone else was trying to help too, cause I'm frankly stumped. Just to find out if I am mostly wrong or totally wrong, can you try an experiment for me? Do the Ctrl-Alt-Del thing and open task manager, click on processes and then select Excel.  Then do your sort and see if Excel's memory usage goes nuts. Granted, if it doesn't I have no idea what the problem is, and if it does I don't know what the cause of the memory issue would be, but my ""first rule of troubleshooting,"" is narrow the cause down. OK, that isn't true, my first rule is ""shut up and reboot,"" but that doesn't apply here ;) At this point I'd even appreciate a microsoft employee on the thread, they wouldn't do anything, but maybe someone who knows something would then show up to correct them...  Other questions on the ""narrow it down"" theme: What happens if you copy the worksheets in the workbook to a new workbook and save it, and then try to sort the new workbook? Similar trick, copy the cells that you are trying to sort and paste (probably paste values) them into a new workbook and sort there? What version of Office are you using? Does this only happen when you sort by one particular column, or does it happen regardless of which column you sort by? If it is only one column, what else is happening in the column? Do you have another workbook with a similar sized chunk of information (40 columns) that you can try to sort to see if it is just the one workbook/set of data or if it is a general your copy of excel problem? Does the number of rows you can sort by change if you just select some of your columns and sort them (don't save just in case it does work, but...)?

"Your first two suggestions: 1) What happens if you copy the worksheets in the workbook to a new workbook and save it, and then try to sort the new workbook? 2) Similar trick, copy the cells that you are trying to sort and paste (probably paste values) them into a new workbook and sort there? What version of Office are you using?  Thank You, Thank You, Thank You ! ! !  The first thing I tried was copying the cells into a new workbook.  Yeah, it worked.

"You are quite welcome, glad I could help. As for the old workbook, I wouldn't bother as long as you have what you need.  Files can become corrupt (well, not corrupt in the traditional sense, but odd rules start to apply to older files that don't make sense or apply to new files), and you never know what is attached to a workbook that you can't see.  The ""copy all sheets into new workbook,"" trick is one I use from time to time just to deal with an excel file that is unusually large or slow compared to how it should be.

"First of all, the instructions from Christopher Chen will cause trouble sooner or later: A user document saved with the name Normal.dotm will not function properly as a basis for new documents. The Normal.dotm must be generated by the program.  It would have been better to Open the original Normal.dotm & change the Zoom level there. Unfortunately, this has been made difficult due to Apple's decision to make the Library folders for User Accounts Hidden by default [OS X 10.7 & later]. As a result it cannot be accessed from within the program unless you first UnHide that folder. Hopefully you have not deleted your former Normal.dotm template or did follow the suggestion to create a backup of it. If that's the case I'd suggest that you:   To retrieve your MacChristopherros as well as any User-Defined Styles, & AutoText Items: If you haven't deleted your former Normal.dotm template, use the Organizer to copy the customizations from one template or document to another. The Organizer can be reached from either of several directions:  The newly generated Normal.dotm will be displayed in one column. Close the Document1 in the other column & navigate to Open the former Normal.dotm containing your macros. See the Word article:  Make a macro available to all documents in Word 2016 for MacChristopher - Word ...  If you have deleted your former Normal.dotm based on the instructions from TinaChristopher Chen without creating a backup... well, all I can say is that her reply is evidence of the adage ""A little knowledge can be a dangerous thing."" You still may be able to use Organizer to copy macros from other documents into the new Normal.dotm template.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Thank you for the reply.  I do have a comment and question.  My PPT is only one slide.  I want to use it while teaching and only play parts of the audio file.  Microsoft says the Android version will play an audio file.  I have embedded 5 objects to the same audio file just playing different portions of it.  There will be no continuous play or playing across slides.  The audio does stop playing at the chosen time but will not start at the time I have chosen.  It starts at the beginning.   Does the Android version support playing audio that was created on Windows 10 using the Trim feature?     Thanks again for your assistance....,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

I wish to copy a cell in a worksheet to other areas within the same worksheet but also to other worksheets within the workbook.  The formula needs to indicate that this cell is constant and does not change whether I copy it elsewhere within the worksheet or outside to other worksheets with the workbook. Thanks John,"[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"BB, re:  a constant cell  Maybe use something similar to this...    '--- Jim Cone Portland, Oregon USA https://goo.gl/IUQUN2 (Dropbox) (free & commercial excel add-ins & workbooks)","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"I think we need to clarify your question. If your cell is in Sheet1!B14... To tell other cells to display (and allow you to use the value of) that cell, put in those cells =Sheet1!B14. If you want to take the value that is in the cell and put it in those other cells, you can copy, then do a ""paste-special"" and choose ""values.""  This will copy the value of the cell you are copying from rather than the formula.  To paste-special either click the downward arrow just below paste in the macro bar or right click the cell you want to paste into and below ""paste options"" will be ""paste special."" If you copy a cell with a formula, excel will automatically copy it's relations to other cells in a ""relative,"" manner, so if your formula in the cell is =A12+B6 and you copy your formula to a cell two cells lower it will become =A14+B8.  so fix this use fixed references, which are indicated with a $ symbol.  So if you want to copy =A12+b6 to another cell in the same page, you can change it to =$A$12+$B$6.  Note that both the column and row get a $.  This is handy because it allows you to ""lock"" one part of the formula and not the other.  You can also press F4 to cycle through the lock options. If you create your formula in a single sheet, the formula won't bother to remember what sheet it is in, so if you copy that formula to another sheet it will use the same reference on the new sheet.  But if you add your sheet name to your formula then copying that formula will always reference that sheet.  So =A12+B6 will give you A12+B6 of whatever sheet you copy the formula to, but =sheet1$A$12+sheet1$B$6 will always refer to A12+B6 of sheet 1.  Hope this helps!   ","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"Hi, I am creating a document with many vector images involving numerous effects. I draw vector images in inkscape, and then convert them in EMF format for use in MS Word.

The use of vector image is very important and it is very unlikely that I would use a raster image (unless the illustration used is a picture).

"Any software that produces EMF will likely have the same kinds of problems.  EMF/WMF graphics are fairly primitive and don't include the ability to handle things like gradient fills, soft edges/shadows and the like.  Instead, programs that export EMF have to perform workarounds; to ""preserve"" a gradient, they'll export gazillions of rectangles or polygons that, together, look like a single gradient filled shape.  Editing these?  A nightmare!  I would suggest this workflow:  Draw your graphics in any program that works well for you, but stick with simple shapes and lines.  Don't do any gradient fills or other fancy effects.  Export as EMF, import the EMF into PowerPoint, ungroup it and THEN apply any effects you like to the shapes.  Once you do this, the graphic will be in native MS Office format; you can copy/paste it from PPT to Word and it should retain all of its characteristics.  You might, in fact, be able to import the EMF directly into Word, ungroup and apply effects there.  Since PPT is the tool I use most often, I'd rather work there and then copy to Word, but if going directly to Word works well for you, leave PPT out of the equation entirely. ","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

One can define a shape to extracted from the original image and crop every thing else (for example, the image you made is a rectangular vector image and you just want the circular image of a part, you can clip that image by drawing a circle over the part you wish to extract, then select both the image and the circle, and apply clipping effect).

But you can use the Merge Shapes command on the Format | Insert Shapes area to do a one-time clip (ie, you can use intersect to combine an image, for example with a shape and end up with the image clipped to the shape boundaries ... as a new shape that replaces the original shapes).

"Hi!.  I think the workaround is a good idea if you have plenty of time and not a lot of graphics.  I'm working on a major document project requiring close to 600 graphics in the next month...   so this workaround is not going to be useful and would actually double the workload - not to mention would probably be better if (ugh) i just create originally in powerpoint (not fond of).  I'm currently using illustrator 2017 on a windows 10 system.  the requirements say they want the word document in 2010 format AND a PDF that is 100% editable including the graphics.   I'm saving out vector art in EMF format but they look really really bad - lines get jacked, curves get pixelated etc - yes we're using bevels and some gradients (only as necessary) - we're also getting odd artifacts on the EMF (white borders for no apparent reason) that are confusing.  also noted that we cannot open emf files in photoshop for quick trims (of those white borders).  (grrrr)  Any help at all on suggesting how we get vector AI files exported out for insertion into word and subsequent editable PDF formatting would be greatly appreciated since i'm still in the early production stages but am facing a total sunami of art in the next week or so.....  eeek! :)","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"I'm not an AI user but in the past I've seen the problem with curves and such getting pixelated (actually, they're being rendered as a series of short lines, not getting pixelated, but the effect is similar).  The fix there seems to be to make the shapes as big as possible in AI before exporting to EMF.  Or at least this is how it used to work; apparently AI breaks curves into XX segments per point or inch or whatever.  The bigger you make the graphic, the more segments you get, so the smoother the line.   As far as gradients, my experience has been that you're better off leaving things flat-colored in AI then ungrouping and applying gradients in PPT.  Otherwise, the gradient is liable to turn into a skillion individual shapes, making editing a nightmare.

"Skype for 'Windows Desk Top' and 'Windows 10' Since sometime now, I call a person in my skype contacts, but as soon as my spokesperson picks up the call, Skype hangs up, and I get the message """"The content of this message is unsupported"" "". Same issue if my contact tries to calls me. I checked out problem on internet and read that there could be several reasons for the call failing. It could be a problem with your microphone or speakers, or the camera device. One could try calling echo123 to make sure that your devices work fine. It could also be a problem with the remote party your calling. Maybe they're using an older version of Skype that is no longer supported.  Well I tried all the remedies proposed however with regret I report that the problem persists.In sequence a.) I uninstalled skype, restarted my laptop and installed skype traditional version from link provided in skype support. Problem remained. b.) I uninstalled the traditional version previously installed and installed the version for windows 10, since la[top runs on windows 10. Problem remained. c.)

"Hello Edgar Banks,     Welcome to the Skype Community forum! I do understand the inconvenience you have faced.   To resolve audio issues on Skype calls, you and the person you’re calling should follow the steps below:   1. Use the latest version of Skype. We're always improving call quality, so for best performance, make sure that you and the person you're calling are using the latest version of Skype. Download the latest version.   2. Check your connection. If your audio or video calls freeze, your video looks block-like or has motion blur, it might be your internet connection (or your friend's) causing the problem. If Skype detects a weak connection, it will reduce the quality to try and stop the call from dropping altogether.   • Using a computer? Plug your Ethernet cable directly into your modem or router. If you're using Wi-Fi, try moving closer to the router. If you're not connected, the Windows 10 guide Why can't I get online? will give you tips to fix any connection issues.   • Using a mobile device? Use a speed test app to check the performance of your mobile connection, and check the result against the download and upload speeds required for Skype.   3. Is another application interfering with your call? Close any applications that could be interfering with your call. File sharing applications, streaming audio or video, or even just having a web browser open are all things that can eat up bandwidth.   To troubleshoot problems with Skype calls, please refer to this link: Troubleshooting problems with Skype calls   I hope this helps. Should you have further queries, please do not hesitate to reply to this post.   Thank you.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"For starters, Skype has no phone technical support number.  Performing a more thorough search should inform you that the number you are dialing is a scam number out to steal your information and money.  They have no access to your Skype account or your computer unless you provide them with that information.  I have had a Skype number for over a decade.  If you just set up a Skype number it may take some time to activate initially (possibly 24 hours or so).  If you are online in Skype and people call that phone number from their mobile or landline number, your Skype client should ring.  A Skype number is an inbound-only subscription.  A Skype number by itself does include any ability to dial phone numbers for free.  That still requires credit or a subscription.   You may want to determine whether inbound call  issues are solely related to the client version on your phone or its sleep status.  Having a static client that is on 24x7 may prove to be more reliable for inbound calls as variables are reduced.  You may want to try a desktop or the web client just to see if calls are getting through on those Skype clients.  If you need to get a hold of Skype Customer Service, you can do so over live chat.  To do so, contact Skype Customer Service for assistance.  To reach that support you simply need to choose the correct topic, sub-topic and click on ""Next"" to get a live chat option.  The best topic and sub-topic for this issue would probably be: Payments & Orders - Help with a subscription","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

I checked that my computer speed was fast enough, and it is.. i checked my internet connection speed.. and that too is apparently fast enough for a video call.. so why cant i turn my cam back on? Is there a possibility that i am on hold while the person at the other end used their cam for something else? There is no notification that I am on hold, and i have asked that they let me know when they get the chance so i dont waste time hunting for a solution to a non existant problem.

"Hi,  I just want to clarify things here, are you using a computer along with its camera to make a video call but using your phone's Wi-Fi data? (based from what you've mentioned: ""I checked that my computer speed was fast enough""). If so, when you do a phone call, that will interfere the connection that Skype is getting from your device and the call will be interrupted. In that case, you have to stop the video call and start over again for the camera to work.  If my understanding above is incorrect and if you're using your phone and its camera to make a video call - same thing will happen. The bottom line is, you're using the data of your phone which I believe is coming from its network (signal). Wi-Fi data is connected through it thus; network disruption will occur.

"Many thanks for responding, Janet. I have been able to update headers and footers using the window you showed above.  I'm afraid I wasn't very clear about what I'm trying to do. I'm trying to apply changes I made to the Notes Master (font, font size, position of the slide, size of the notes text box). I have looked everywhere for the command to do this while on the notes page.   A tedious workaround (I am working with a slide library of 3500 slides):   Copy the notes from the notes page. Delete the notes placeholder on that page. Go to the Normal view and paste ""Keep text only"" in the notes portion below the slide. Go back to Notes Page to make sure it worked.  I fear some of the problems have resulted from many slide layouts and template changes, many slides copied and pasted among presentations and switching between PowerPoint and Keynote and back again. I'm sure the presentations were created with many versions of both PowerPoint and Keynote. I was hoping the Notes Master had improved since Office 365 2016 was release.  That said, THANK YOU MICROSOFT for allowing multiple pages of notes to print! YAY. That's a great improvement that I didn't know about. ","[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

"Janet, Yes, I am changing the notes master in View tab - Notes Master.  I am on Office 365 and should have the most recent version. I don't have any pending updates. Version 15.37 is what the about box shows.  My guess is that there are some slides that were pasted in from various presentations and some how they kept their original formatting and won't change when Notes Master is changed. Some slides do seem to update to the new format while others don't. I have found some slides with multiple text boxes (on top of one another) so the bottom one (which isn't visible) is updated with some stray box on top of it in the old format.   Another oddity is that some slides (possibly originally created in Keynote) let me change the font but won't let me change formatting (bold, italic). Really weird.  I am plowing through this with my workaround but it would be swell if there was easy access to an ""Apply Notes Master"" command on every page like there used to be. (I think it was a right click to the list of commands.) The only reliable way to change the Notes formatting themselves is to cut the text, delete the text box, and go to Normal view and Paste Text Only which recreates the text box with the current Notes Master formatting. But this won't change the placement of the slide (which I have occasionally had to move or make smaller). Sometimes the only work around to fix that is to create a new slide, copy the slide elements to it and copy the notes. Thanks for anything you might be able to do to help in the future. I have a deadline so unfortunately, I have to muscle through this manually right now. ","[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]"
"Hi Michael,   Thanks for your clarification.

"Susan,  Thanks for trying to help.  I applied the modifications you listed but am still not hearing my voice recording during the Skype Echo test.  I'm trying to find a contact who is online, at the moment, but because I was failing this test when I first noticed my contact couldn't hear me, I'm reasonable sure that , as the recording says, there is something wrong with my audio settings..  My computer is Windows Vista, version 6.0 with Service Pack 2 and the Skype version is 7.36.0.150.  I understand that Vista is no longer supported and about a week ago when I received a notice to update Skype, that was when the problems appeared to start.  I actually contacted a technician by phone who loaded and installed the update.  I believe the Echo test was working at that time, however, but I do remember I was not able to connect with one of my contacts, as none were online at that time.  I tried to find a ""live"" technician last night, but was unable to find a technical support phone number for Skype.  Do you have a good number for their technical support office?  Thanks for trying, I do realize most of the problems are arising due to an obsolete operating system and the very slow download speeds provided to our neighborhood by Verizon.  We only get a little over 3 mps.

"I'm trying to create a Kiosk-type presentation and I want additional info to pop up next to the mouse cursor when I hover over certain text/image in a slide. I've been Googling about it and so far, I've only found out about the Hyperlink -> Bookmark -> Screentip feature. But with this method though, I am quite limited in the number of characters I can use and also, there's no text formatting (layout, indentation, new line space, etc.) I only end up with a square wall of text.  Is there another way of achieving what I have in mind without having to create another slide for it that simulates a pop up text box? I simply want a simple-looking tooltip that can contain somewhat extensive text descriptions in a easy-to-read layout and so far, Google doesn't seem to want to lead me to the right place so here I am instead.  Also; Is it possible to simply have a small image (a drawing of a clipboard with a few click-able links on it) to slide in after I click on something on the current slide?  To elaborate: The current slide has many interactive images (action buttons) in it, one of which is a small shape (or an image of a button) with the text ""HINTS"" in it. I would like it to be able to click it so that a drawing of a clipboard would then slide in -- the said clipboard drawing also contains a few more interactive buttons in it. Clicking on the HINTS button again would hide the clip board. Now, while the clipboard is still present on the screen, I still want to be able to have access to the other buttons that are already present prior to having the clipboard slide in.  How would you go about this? The only way I could think of right now is to duplicate the slide, add the clip board image on the duplicated slide and then have the HINTS button on the first slide link to the duplicate slide (with the clipboard present) and then link the HINTS button on the duplicate slide to the first slide (the one without the clipboard). I think that method is very time-consuming and duplicating stuff might end up drastically enlarging the file size.  Is there a much more efficient way of achieving what I have in mind? Or is it not possible at all? Thanks in advance!","[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]"
"Hello,  As for creating the pop-ups, you can use the Screentip feature. Though if the feature will limit you when it comes to the amount of characters, an option is to use a duplicate slide.

"Hi James,   I’m glad to hear that your issue has already been resolved. Just a reminder, to have a good call quality in using Skype for Mac, make sure that you and the person you are calling are using the latest version.  If you’re audio call is delayed or with poor quality please check your connection. It might be your internet connection (or your friend's) causing the problem.If Skype detects a weak connection, it will reduce the quality to try and stop the call from dropping altogether.   Close any applications that could be interfering with your call. File sharing applications, streaming audio or video, or even just having a web browser open are all things that can eat up bandwidth.   If the issue still persist you can try to uninstall, then reinstall the Skype application. Make test call after a successful reinstall.   Thank you!

The Skype for Windows 10 App has no such feature or menu.  You have two options:  1.  Sign into your old account on the Skype for Windows 10 App by signing out of the current account and resigning in using your old accounts information.  2.  Sign into Skype for Windows Desktop using your new account and import the contacts you exported from your old account.  Both clients should be able to support your old and new accounts.

"PROBLEM: I have email addresses in an Excel file (Mac 2016). When I click on them I get the alert - ""Cannot open specified file"" Does anyone know how to make proper clickable email links that will allow them to open up in my Mac Mail program? Not as critical, but I also have a column of website links that I'd like to turn into clickable links. They already have the proper http formatting. http://google.com (for example) BACKGROUND NOTES: Initially I was copying and pasting the email addresses into Excel. At that point they were clickable. But the font formatting and font sizes were all over the place. So I selected the entire column and clicked Edit > Clear > Formats. This cleaned things up nicely. But the underline and blue text highlighting disappeared. I assumed that they were not clickable at that point (that is debatable now) so I found some forum thread that explained how to format them back as clickable emails. It's been weeks since I did it, but I think that I may have highlighted the column and clicked ""fn"" and ""F2"" at the same time. Could be wrong about that. After doing some more research I noticed that if I hover over the cell it shows an address that looks like this: file://///NoServer/*** Email address is removed for privacy *** (for example). It should probably be mailto:*** Email address is removed for privacy *** (for example) but I don't know how to fix them. Another weird thing to note is that I have some blank cells with no email address. They also kick back that alert ""Cannot open specified file"". And if I hover over the cell it shows. file://///NoServer/NoFolder","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"Hi Anthony,   First, I would like to explain that if you clear the format of the link or email address, the underline and blue text will be removed. However, you still can click the link or email address to open it.   About the issue “Cannot open specified file”, I suggest you try the following steps to check if the issue still exists: 1. Right click the cell which is affected. 2. Select Edit Hyperlink. 3. Select Email Address. 4. Retype the address again as below:    If the issue still exists, could you please provide the following information? 1. The Office version and OS version. 2. Check if other files also have the issue. 3. The screenshot of Edit Hyperlink. 4. The screenshot of error message.   Thanks, QingLisa","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Hi Lisa,  Thanks for the reply!  I was able to do as you suggested and manually added the ""mailto:"" part to the address and it opened right up in Mac Mail.  Note that it defaults to opening up the edit hyperlink window with the ""Web Page or File"" tab selected, not the ""Email Address"" tab. I didn't realize that at first and simply added ""mailto:"" to the address field that reads ""Link to an existing file or web page."". This worked though. When I click OK, test and then go back to the Edit window, the information updates and gets transferred to the correct ""Email Address"" tab. So that's good!  I did notice that it shows the ""mailto:"" code in the actual cell of the worksheet instead of being hidden code. When I go back in to check the edit hyperlink window it shows ""Text to Display:"" with the ""mailto:"" code, but the actual ""Email address:"" field shows the email address without the ""mailto:"" code. I can go back in manually and remove that mailto:"" from the Text to Display field and it still works properly. This is how a brand new email being added looks like in the Edit Hyperlink window. There is no ""mailto:"" code in either field. So it must automatically add the proper code behind the scenes to function.  Another thing to note is that when I go into one of the messed up emails and it opens automatically to the Web Page or File tab - the text to display field shows ""http://*** Email address is removed for privacy ***"" (for example). So that is probably what is causing the problem. So, my next question then...  Is there a way to update multiple cells at one time? I have hundreds of email addresses that need to be updated and editing manually would be very time consuming/expensive.  Thanks, James","[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]"

Since I am Italian, I was only able to download the Italian version and all the functions names are in Italian. This is giving me a headache since I have to go and look for each single one of them cause otherwise it won't understand the english comands. It's making it basically impossible to use! Do you know if I can change the language or if I can download the english version somewhere else? This would be amazing for me. Thank you very much in advance for your answers! Cheers,","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

"I have a table with a column of time stamps. These come from an external source and the cell is configured as ""custom h:mm"". I have created a 2nd table with deduplicated values of the time stamps. Then I am using a VLOOKUP function to match the values from the deduplicated table to the original one. Some of the return values are correct, while others are incorrect, and I don't understand why. I've tried to use VALUE function and change the columns to another form of data other than time, but it did not work. This is an example from the original table. Column A is the time stamps and column B is the return values from the second table (below).   0:11 11 1:06 18 1:09 21 1:11 23 2:06 15 2:05 29 1:03 11 2:10 34 1:02 11 2:06 15 2:06 15 6:06 78 3:05 14 This is the second table I have created: 0:11 11 1:06 18 1:09 21 1:11 23 2:06 30 2:05 29 1:03 15 2:10 34 1:02 14 6:06 78 3:05 41 As you can see, values like 0:11, 2:05 and 6:06 return correctly, while values for 2:06 and 3:05 do not. I have no idea why this is happening. Any ideas? P.S. The source of the original time stamp comes from a very old external software and there is no way to reimport the data differently.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
"First, show us the VLOOKUP formula.  In fact, show us all formulas.  And add cell references to your table.  Details are important.  Second, as a wild guess, if you use VLOOKUP without a 4th parameter or 1 or TRUE in the 4th parameter, there are two possible problems.  1. The values in column A are not in ascending order.  2. There might be binary arithmetic anomalies, such that two values that look the same actually differ infinitesimally (and perhaps invisibly) in their binary representation.  I suggest that you upload an example Excel file (redacted) that demonstrates the problem to a file-sharing website (e.g. box.net/files) so that we can see the details better.  Post the public/share URL in a response here.  Please test the URL first, being careful to log out of the file-sharing website.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

"Hi Hayden,   Have you viewed joeu2004Brittany's reply? I would like to explain that when we use VLOOKUP, by default, the table must be sorted in an ascending order. @ joeu2004Brittany, @AshishTroy Mathur, thanks for your suggestions.   @nimrodyanaiHayden, in your case, I would like to suggest you use Advance Filter.

See Turn Windows features on or off   Note: Windows Media Player would be listed under Media Features. Uncheck Windows Media Player and restart the computer to disable WMP. Re-check the same and restart to enable WMP.

"Hi Julie and thanks for finally getting back to me. Amazing that Microsoft shoots itself in the foot by making it so much less attractive to bother giving customers what they want and need.  I now have no reason to use Skype number vs. Google number and I am now totally unhappy that I even paid for it.  Maybe this is one to bump up the chain to Microsoft - 1. The reason to get a skype number (and same reason people get a google number) is to have a VOIP replacement for a landline. One that potentially small consulting businesses like me might want to use as a face to clients. However, clients and in fact people, don't like to be reminded they are reaching a VOIP generic number. When you take the ability to personalize away, you defeat the purpose for some of us. Google knows this, why don't you?  2. Microsoft's customer service has frankly always been terrible and it seems to somehow be getting worse and worse. Skype has fallen down in it's ability to be what it used to be and partly for these two reasons. The fact that it can take weeks to get help or a response is appalling.   Frankly...These days I look at Microsoft and scratch my head wondering why you drive away customers by making it so difficult for them to love your services. Is Microsoft now only about selling volume in foreign countries and doesn't care at all about service?  As someone who's been in the tech industry for many years, watched the rise and now what looks like the fall that could be another rise if this attitude were fixed, I see so many opportunities missed by the company on all fronts. Why has Google risen and outstripped you? Giving the User what they want and need and with good service. Why have companies like Amazon won the market? Customer service and giving customers what they want and need with ease.  Looking down the line at services that are now filling the gap you have sitting right in the palm of your corporate hand...You will lose more and more of this market share unless you start paying attention. In taking away something as simple as the ability to have a personalized message to whoever calls me replaced my some generic message that makes people hang up...Let's just say you are alienating customers.  I will now stop paying you for what I can not use. A shame. Really a shame.  Please DO bump that up the chain. It'll probably go nowhere and fall on deaf ears, but frankly....I am now going back to not using Microsoft products the way I was.  ","[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]"

"If you play around with Calibre, you will find that it can convert an ePub from one format to another if you have a different ebook reader.  It gets updates all the time to include new drivers for ebook readers.  The program is so good, Amazon has thought about using it as a server for all their ePubs they sell.  It converts automatically to the ebook reader you have and you are not stuck buying a bunch of them in order to get the books you want.  It is a little weird on display but seems to work quite well.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

However, I would appreciate if you could answer a few questions to narrow down the issue in order to provide you with better assistance.   Let’s try these methods below and check if that solves the problem.  Method 1: Try Hardware and devices troubleshooter   The hardware and devices troubleshooter can detect and fix errors and incorrect settings in devices. You can run the built in troubleshooter in Windows 8 and check by following these steps: a) Press Windows Key + X, select control panel b) Change the ‘view by’ option on the top right to ‘Larger icons’ c) Select the Troubleshooting option and click ‘view all’ on the left panel d) Run the ‘Hardware and devices ‘troubleshooter.   Method 2:  Let’s follow the steps in the article below and check if that helps in solving the problem.  Troubleshoot wired keyboards that don’t respond or that type wrong characters http://support.microsoft.com/kb/258826/en-us  Note: This article deals with Windows 7 but steps provided holds good for Windows 8.1 too.  Method 3:  If problem persists let’s check the issue by using OSK (On screen keyboard) and see if issue persists or not. If issue will not appear it means the issue is with keyboard.  Windows also has the On-Screen Keyboard (OSK), an Ease of Access tool. Use the OSK instead of a physical keyboard to move around your PC and enter text. You don’t need a touchscreen to use the OSK. The OSK displays a visual keyboard with all the standard keys. Select keys using the mouse or another pointing device, or use a physical single key or group of keys to cycle through the keys on the screen.  Use the On-Screen Keyboard (OSK) to type  Hope this would help.

As you suggested, this fixed the problem of having 100's of entries and duplicates in my Skype Contacts List.  However, I should stress to others reading this thread that the App doesn't use the word 'sync' during set-up. It is just the normal 'allow Skype to access your contacts' permission. Usually you would grant apps this permission during install, and then things like syncing and managing contacts would have options in the App itself.  In the Privacy settings, the App does have the option 'sync your address book', which is enabled by default (hence my problem). But if you subsequently disable it (after allowing the App to access your address book) it does not remove the entries added already. This App currently has no other options to manage your contacts.

For the Windows machine I have also tried Windows 7 and Windows 8, also non server type hardware with identical results. so.. Why am I not getting > 1 Gbps throughput on the created team? although load balancing is activated, team adapter says the connection type is 2 Gbps, a the same setup with 2 unix machines works flawlessly. Am I to understand that Link Aggregation (802.3ad) under Microsoft OS does not support load balancing if connection is only towards one IP? To make it clear, I need client version of Windows OS to communicate unix based OS over a higher then 1Gbps bandwidth (as close to 2 Gbps as possible). Without the use of 10 Gbps network adapters.

"Hi Jason TejaNalabothula,  Welcome to the Skype Community Forum.  If the person you're calling is not initiating screen sharing, but your screen is still being shared, I strongly recommend you to completely uninstall and reinstall Skype to reset its configuration settings.   To completely uninstall, and then reinstall Skype for Mac: Important: If you’d like to keep your chat and call history, skip step #3.  *By default, the Library folder is hidden in Mac OS X v10.7 “Lion” and higher. To find your Library folder, open Finder and, from the menu bar, select Go, press and hold the option key, and then select Library. And by the way, make sure that video call button   is selected and not the screen share button.  Please do not hesitate to reply to this thread if you have any additional questions or concerns.

"I have been running Windows-7 for over a year now. But one thing that keeps happening is the ""Not Responding""  message. Does not matter what program I am using - Excel, Word, Outlook, and other NON-Microsoft programs. Example:  Excel: I can be entering Data - Type, Enter, Type, move mouse, type, move mouse, type use curser, etc. Then all of a sudden everything stops and it says NOT RESPONDING at the top. Can't do anything for 10 - 60 sec.  Then all is back to normal. This happens MANY MANY times per day. Another thing - maybe related - I am in Windows Explorer (or similar) and I sub file down to where I need to be and then click on a file to open - Example Excel.  Most of the time it opens in a few seconds. But sometimes it takes forever to open up and in the top bar when it shows the folders and sub-folders, a green bar starts going from left to right.  Nothing else happens and the bar so very slow.   Then somewhere between 50%-80% of the distance from left to right, the green bar will suddenly zoom all the way to the right and then the file opens. To me it is almost like a NOT Responding and the bar is trying.  Then when it decides to Respond the bar goes to the end and the file opens. Any clue about all these delays? By the way, I also have Process Explorer open and it shows nearly 80% plus SYSTEM IDLE. Of course I do not know what it says DURING the stoppage because I can't do much during the stoppage.

This issue could be caused due to some incorrect settings or an incompatible/corrupt Bluetooth driver.

" Hi Andy,     It appears that the issue is caused by the Bluetooth adapter driver. Error code 43 is reported when one of the driver controlling the Bluetooth adapter notifies the operating system that the device failed in some manner. This issue could be caused either due to a corrupt driver or due to a hardware failure. I would suggest you to first download the latest Bluetooth driver from the manufacturer’s website and install it. If the issue was caused due to a driver issue, updating the drivers would resolve the issue. Here is a link to download the Windows 8.1 driver for Inspiron 17 7737:     http://www.dell.com/support/drivers/uk/en/ukdhs1/Product/inspiron-17-7737     If updating the Bluetooth driver didn’t resolve the issue, then it could be a hardware failure. In this case, you can contact your computer manufacturer’s support for further assistance:     http://www.dell.com/support/Contents/uk/en/ukdhs1/category/Contact-Information/Technical-Support?~ck=mn     You can also refer to this article for more information:  http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310123/en-us     Hope this helps.

"Hi,  Quoting works a little quirkily. We're planning to make it more intuitive, but for the moment here's how it works.  -The first step is to do what you do, right click and select Quote. This places the message to be quoted in Clipboard.  - The second step is to paste in the chatbox. This adds the quote to input field and you can type your message below it.  The thinking at the time was that this would make it easier to pick a quote from one chat and send the quote in another chat. But the drawback is that it's not so discoverable. We'll try and make it better in a future update.  Hope this helps, Rachel","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

"Hi Brett,  Strange as this may sound, it's actually good news.  If you don't know already, Microsoft has been testing a new Visual Basic for Applications Editor for Office for Mac in Insider Fast builds. The test was very successful and everyone loves the new editor. The only remaining part that needs to finished for the editor is the Userform editor component. That there is suddenly a new glitch in userforms is a strong indication that Microsoft is working on UserForms now. So this makes me very happy.  Of course, this is a big pain for you, and I can understand your scowl at my happiness.  Steven pointed to Ron's thread. Ron submitted a bug report to Microsoft, and you should, too. Use the Smile button in Excel and send a frown. The squeaky wheel gets the grease!  Meanwhile, for your production environment, I'd say restore the most recent build that worked right (probably 15.37) using Time Machine. Choose Keep Both. Also, turn AutoUpdate to manual, so it doesn't trash your restored version of Excel.  While I can't promise that running two different versions of Excel won't cause other strange behaviors, it's the best I can offer you for now. In theory, you shouldn't even be able to do this, because Office should be doing a checksum to make sure the install hasn't been tampered with. But it seems to work, anyway.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

I am aware/glad they are working on the editor. But fort this to make it to a production build is unacceptable.   Unfortunately, rolling back via time machine isn't an option for 400+ machines. I've reported this issue to the system admins in case it needs to be rolled back (if it can).  Userforms are the worst place for VBA to fail because it's the user interface. Users are less likely to  care/won't know if there's a bug in Non-UI code. This bug has the helpdesk phones ringing. The people that use these macros are decision makers and they literally cannot use the macros that have been in place for years. This is a major QA fail on Microsoft's part.

"Hello everyone I have the following system: * Nokia Lumina 2520 tablet running Windows RT 8.1 I have had the tablet from new since December 2013 and it has run perfectly until just a few weeks ago, when Windows Updates stopped working.  I had tried to solve this issue through a wide range of means identified on this forum, but without success and so I have today reinstalled Windows RT 8.1 (not refreshed), specifying even that this re-installations should be for the purpose of the PC being recycled.  I would imagine that this means that it is the cleanest re-install possible. The reinstall went smoothly and I allowed it it use default settings.  Based on this, I have not changed any system settings.  This was also the state that the tablet was installed in when I initially bought it and when Windows Update worked correctly. I have connected to the internet using a tried and tested connection with no problems and have run Windows Update for the first time.

Missiing Windows Installation Media for Asus TF600T Windows RT 8.1 and I need it so I can do a factory reset,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Hello Sammy,  Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.  I would like to know some information about the issue so that we could help you better.  What is the reason of performing factory reset?  I appreciate your efforts towards resolving the issue.  Before you perform factory reset, I would suggest you to perform startup repair from Windows recovery environment and check if it helps.  If you can't start (boot) your PC, follow these instructions to get to the ""Windows Recovery Environment"". You may need to connect a keyboard to complete the steps. Please follow these steps:  a. Do one of the following, depending on whether you have installation media (such as a DVD or USB flash drive):  - If you have installation media for Windows 8.1, start (or boot) your computer from the installation media. Insert the DVD or USB flash drive and restart your computer. If you see a message asking you to ""Press any key to boot from DVD or USB"", do so. If you don’t see the message, you might need to change the boot order in your computer's BIOS settings so that it first starts from the DVD or USB. When you see the ""Install Windows"" page, tap or click ""Repair your computer"" to start the ""Windows Recovery Environment"".  - If you don’t have installation media, use the power button to restart your computer three times. This will start the ""Windows Recovery Environment"".  b. In the ""Windows Recovery Environment"", on the ""Choose an option"" screen, click ""Troubleshoot"".  c. Click ""Startup repair"" and follow on-screen instructions.  Important Notes: Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.  I highly recommend backing up all of your important files and folders onto an external storage device before attempting any type of OS repair or upgrade.  You may create Windows 8.1 installation media from this link: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media  I hope this information helps.

"I notice that the new version of Skype has lots  off bells and whistles ..  It allows me to speak to the whole world .. ( not that anyone is interested ) What is missing is an email  contact for problems .. Looked for an hour and could not find one . The new version has now no way to put in a name for a contact .. I can insert a phone number .. but not a name. The basic functionality is gone!  .. Solid Gone! So we have a great thing with functionality I do not need ,.. but basic things like creating a contact is no longer possible .. Why? It used to work well a year or two ago ... Now I find I'm using messenger on F/b .. cos it works .. But if the person is not on that .. I cannot  .. ( yes there are people not on F/b .. Most are old .. like me .. so we don't matter much!!) If there was an alternative .. I would move .. Floating around all this stuff for several hours trying to find how to insert a name  for a phone number is frustrating! And on top of that ... not possible. This is not a social media platform .. I just want to be able to contact  friends .. Not the world! Whoever is developing this has lost the plot! Thanks !

I am not able to hear any sound on ringing sound on my PC when placing a video call.

I can hear it on the laptop and have checked all settings which seem to be correct. I am using the Logitec Pro C910 webcam and all audio test say it is configured correctly.

I will do that tomorrow when I turn on the PC but isn't the classic version the one Skype just discontinued support for. I just uninstalled Skype 3.6 (I think that was the version or 3.9) because they said that was an older version that they didn't support any longer. When I first started using this new version the ringing on my PC when I placed a video call was not working and I played around with the settings and finally got it so I could click on the screen on the picture of the person while the call was connecting and the ringing would start and the video camera came on but I found a couple of days ago it was not ringing although when I do the Echo test it works and so I guess it is configured correctly. ,"[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]"

"Hi Frederick Gupta  Previously I connected my external SSD drive to the RT and then attempted to boot the tablet. However the tablet refused to boot. I do not remember seeing any error messages. I just presumed they were incompatible.   However after received your reply this morning I decide to boot the RT and then connect the drive. I did this but very soon after connecting the drive I got a blue screen with white reverse type saying: Your PC ran into a problem needs to restart. We are collecting some information and then we will restart it for you. It also stated I could look at the error message at uaspstor.sys. After collection it did commence to restart but never quite got there and after about 20 minutes I forcibly shut it down. I then disconnected the drive and rebooted again and then connected he drive again once the boot was finished. To my surprise after connecting the drive I heard the familiar sound of a USB port connecting. Looking in 'Safely remove hardware and remove media' icon on the taskbar I found it was connected via a 'USB to ATA/Atapi bridge'. I opened file explorer and found I could access and open my files.  However after a short time I received another blue screen with a similar message to that above with the addition of the error IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL . After going through another information collection and restarting procedure the disk seems to be working OK. I can disconnect it via the before mentioned icon, connect it to my windows 10pro desktop and my RT will even boot with the external disk attached.

Major pain.  So I wrote a little VB app that collects the info I want to add then wakes up Outlook, adds a new contact and plugs in the data I've entered.  Boom.  Done.  It's this kind of thing that allows the PPT team to build in features that access Outlook to send presentations by mail.

"Hello John,  Please try to click your Profile in Skype for Android, from there you will see your Skype Credit balance.  If you will not see your balance, kindly try to sign in on the Skype website and check if on the account you will be signed in you will see your balance. There is a possibility you are not signed in on your correct account or your Skype Credit went inactive. If in case it went inactive, all you need to do is reactivate it.

"Hi Timothy,   Good Day!   We understand that you wish to control your status on your account. Please be advised that using Skype for iOS, Skype automatically set your status for you. When you are signed in and online, your status will show ACTIVE NOW.    When you are signed out or offline, your status will show LAST SEEN and how long ago you were online.   If you would prefer to hide your presence status completely, you can change this in your profile settings. Tap your profile picture > Tap the Settings button > Tap Privacy > then you can toggle Show my presence to others on or off.   You still have control over when people can contact you. Turning off the Notification for conversations option will show your presence as Do Not Disturb, which lets your contacts know you aren't currently available.    This will also stop all incoming message notifications, however, you will still receive Skype calls.

"Hello. Asking on behalf of a friend who's recently came out of a long term relationship and is now being harassed by the ex. After blocking his phone number, social media accounts and the like, he's taken to using Skype to call her mobile phone number. However, the number she receives is always ""Unknown"" on her mobile and thus she cannot block it. I've read that apparently Skype calls will generate a new outgoing number each time, so that might be why. But anyway - is there a way to block the numbers to stop that from happening?","[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]"
"Some Android phone have it builtin go to Setting, Call Settings, Call Blocking Settings, Block Mode and tap on Block Unknown Calls and Messages and then tick Block Privet Calls.  Iphone has no block unknown or private numbers settings so you will need an App.  One of the best ones out there is Calls Blacklist (free with adds) or Calls Blacklist PRO (Pay with no adds) that come in Android, ISO and Windows. Calls Blacklist is easy to setup you just go to settings in the App Blocking, tick Private and Unknown numbers and that's it. I would recommend turning in SMS and setting that up to Unknown numbers as well but it will not block MMS as it is data sent.

"I have installed 100+ Surface 2 tablets with a app running in ""lockdown"" mode using assigned access with a password free account and also a selected app. The tablets are running an app that is to operate building automation systems in a system where you can control lights, temperature, sunblind’s etc. from the Surface 2. The Surface 2 has power connected all the time (there might be small interrupts). The VERY BIG PROBLEM is that some of the Surface 2 tablets goes into connected standby even though they all are configured with screen and system sleep set to NEVER. We have used months trying to figure out what is wrong and tried many different thing. The problem is very costly since the need to travel 300 km to access the site where they are installed and the customer’s patience is not that good anymore. We actuall have to go there to get them out of standby. We have different types of standby problems, sometime that can be awakened by just touching the screen, sometimes we have to press the Windows logo 5 times and sometimes we have to hold the power button. When back from standby we either see the app directly or we see the rainbow screen that we need to “slide” away. It does not happen on all tables and the interval seems rater random.

"Hi,  Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community and apologies for late response.  As of now, I would suggest you to place the device in clean boot state and check the status as this could be due to any third party software conflict.  To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a ""clean boot."" A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.   Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.   How to perform a clean boot in Windows            Note: Refer ""How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.

"Still need help.  Thanks for the answer. Makes sense, I guess, since I can't unhook OneDrive. However, I can't do it because I'm having trouble with Live.com. For some reason, I am unable to log in. When I try I keep getting an error message: Your account or password is incorrect. If you don't remember your password please reset.  Except that it doesn't accept the new password either once I changed it. I got stuck in a loop last week resetting the password, neither the new nor old ones not working, and the only option is to set a new password (I can't call MS because there is no help number, and I can't get help on any other issue other than telling me to reset the password, and the chatbot also only referred me to reset my password, no other help). Eventually I apparently logged in here to live.com with a new user name. So no idea how to fix my inability to log into live.com and, hence, onedrive.  I need to combine the new and old live.com accounts or delete one, or whatever. But since I can't log in to my old live.com account, I can't fix the PPT problem. And since I can't call MS help and the chatbot didn't hep, I can't figure out how combine the accounts or fix it.

If the number is his profile number (saved by the owner), it cannot be deleted. It can only be changed by the user itself. However, you can add a secondary number on his profile which you can edit or delete.  Please let us know if you have questions.    Rhiza_ESamantha Skype Community Moderator","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

"Why can't I delete phone numbers in my contacts, please tell me how to do it?  It should not be difficult.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"According to the previous answer, Skype provides contact names with numbers that the contact themselves updates in their profile. We cannot manipulate the numbers because they are being pulled from other people's profiles.   It's like opening a phone book. You don't provide the numbers, the people and businesses that belong to those numbers do. So if you change your phone numbers in your personal Skype profile, it will update everyone's Skype contact list.   This is GOOD if you would rather have up to date information from your list.  This is BAD if you prefer (like I do) not to see every single number from every contact that you'll never use or care about.   I really want my own, personal Skype phone book that I can edit like a regular contact book in every other program I use, not one that can be manipulated by outsiders. ","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Hi Arthur,             Thank you for getting back to us.  Yes, it's not a personal address book which you can edit or delete anytime you want. However, you can add a secondary number like what I've mentioned. The account owner only has the authority to modify the phone number on his account. And apparently, there's no settings to hide the phone numbers in the Skype app. We apologize for the inconvenience.  We'd be glad to hear your feedback.

If someone hacks a Skype account, they get all the contact info from all the users connected to the hacked Skype account instead of only the contact information the account owner would have added themselves otherwise. Seems like there would be less chance of full exposure of other user's account information. Just a thought. ","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

There is no provision in Mac OS for telling the operating system which browser to open based on the hyperlink.  In order to implement your suggestion, the structure of hyperlinks would have to change to incorporate the preferred browser (which might not even be available on a given computer) within the hyperlink.

"Hello,  the table of contents is not designed to update automatically. You need to create a new recipe entry manually.  I find that these steps work:  1. Copy an empty recipe tab 2. Rename the recipe tab, for example call it ""Bangers and Mash"". Put the same name into cell E3 and select a category in cell G3. 3. Go to the ""Recipe Contents"" tab and select the cell of column B in the next empty row below the table. That means if the last recipe is listed in row 9, click cell B9. Edit: typo - click cell B10, not B9. 4. Hold down the Ctrl key and press ""d"". This will copy the formula from the cell above. (Ctrl-D is the keyboard shortcut for ""Copy down""). 5. With cell B10 selected, hit the F2 key to edit the formula. In the downloaded workbook, cell B9 has this formula:  ='Empty Recipe 5'!RecipeName  Change it to   ='Bangers and Mash'!RecipeName  Now you can see the category filled in automatically. If you fill in the other sections on the ""Bangers and Mash"" sheet, the contents will update automatically for that sheet.   ","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"Hi,  This is too easy and I'm hear to show you how!  In the Recipe Name field in the Recipe Content tab, ensure the title of the recipe appears with no markings.  If the recipe is for Galactical Summer Squash, then this should say exactly that and only that in the formula bar when you click on the recipe name in the content tab.  Now, click on the corresponding category cell for this recipe, tip:  this is in column H.  There should be a small grey triangle in the upper left corner of the cell.  When you click on the cell a small yellow diamond box appears (has an exclamation point on it (!).  Hover over this box and a list of options appears.  Choose the second one that says to recalculate the box.  It won't say exactly that but it's the only option with the word recalculate on it.  Now click Click To View and all should be fine. So it's: 1.  Ensure Recipe Name on the Recipe Content Sheet says the correct name with no special characters. 2.  Go to Category box (Column H) for the particular recipe on the Recipe Content Sheet and hover over the yellow diamond box until a list of options appears. 3.  Choose ""Recalculate..."" 4.  Test by selecting ""Click to view"".  Voila!","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]"

"Just noticed you'd responded to this.  What that typically means is that the ""6""key on your keyboard appears to the system as pressed, possibly either stuck in the down position or somehow shorted by something that dropped into the area below the keys.  Most often today this will be due to a liquid spill of something containing sugar or syrup, since this contains enough electrical conductivity to make the key appear to be pressed or otherwise simply cause the key to stick in a pressed position as it slowly dries.  Both the laptop I'm writing this on and the previous one had this happen at least once with lemonade, which eventually caused the sticky keys problem I described above.  The older model was so bad I ordered a replacement from Dell and replaced it myself, fortunately at a cost of only $29 plus shipping.  On this more expensive backlit laptop, I had the time to disassemble and remove the keyboard first, then used clean running water for several minutes to thoroughly flush out the spilled liquid, dry it completely using first a towel and then leaving it overnight to air dry.  One key does still occasionally stick slightly in humid weather, making an audible squishing sound, but not enough to truly cause more than minor annoyance.  It's possible the problem is just something metal under the keys,  but most laptops today don't allow for this, so that's why I'd suspect a liquid spill as most likely.  Erika","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]"

"I have had to reset my Surface RT device due to the fact that it became unresponsive and wouldn't turn on out of it's sleeping state. I am now going about trying to reinstall all of my apps, but unfortunately when I go into the ""your apps"" section of the store it is showing all the apps as unavailable?

You should be able to swipe down on the apps you want and then select install, but because of the problem, the option to install is not even there.

"Hi,  Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.  This issue could be caused due to some incorrect settings or due to a connection issue. I would suggest you to try the following steps and check:   Method 1: Apps troubleshooter   The apps troubleshooter can automatically detect and fix any incorrect settings or errors that could cause issues with apps. You can visit this link to download and run this troubleshooter:   http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=268423   Method 2:   If the troubleshooter didn’t detect any incorrect settings, I would suggest you check and install any updates available for these apps and check. Refer to these steps: a)      Press Windows key + C from the store app. b)      Click on settings and then “App updates”. c)       Click on “Check for updates” to check and install any updates available for apps.   Method 3:   If no updates were available or if installing updates didn’t resolve the issue, then it could be due to some connection issue. If you have installed any third party security software like antivirus program/firewall, they can interfere with the download. I would suggest you to temporarily disable and check if you are able to download the update.   Important Note: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.   Method 4:   If you have setup a proxy connection, I would suggest you to disable the proxy and check. Refer these steps:     Method 5:   If the above steps didn’t help, then I would suggest you to uninstall and reinstall the app and check. When you uninstall the calendar app, the mail and people app will also be removed as these apps are installed as a group. Refer to the section, “reinstall the app” in this link:   http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app   Try these steps and let us know the results.

"On Excel 2013. I have multiple columns of data.

"If your Word 2011 .dot file involved floating toolbars, you should know that those were axed from Word 2016, so you're basically out of luck. Yes, it's a known issue, but they did it on purpose and have no intention of making user-created .dot files compatible from 2011 forward to 2016 beyond the limited functionality you've already discovered, where some buttons continue to work but others are either grayed out/unclickable or don't work as expected, even ones that have worked perfectly for years in 2011.  I've discovered that hard way that you basically need to be a professional programmer if you ever expect to figure out why, or how to fix them. And in your case, it sounds like you didn't even create the original .dot template--your client/company did--so you're probably locked out of editing anyway, even if you did have the coding knowledge.  You should either ask the company who supplied the .dot file if they have an updated version of their template that works with Word 2016 for Mac, or you'll need to go back to using Word 2011.  If your work requires the use of a template that only works in Word 2011--or even if your workflows are just marginally sped up by being able to use those buttons--then Word 2016 probably isn't a viable solution for your needs.  Don't overthink it. Just go back to the version that worked.","[0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]"

"The issue isn't ""random"" :-) It is that the built-in list Styles in Word include a .5"" Left Indent for the list item text. If the number of items goes beyond single digits that Indent often is not enough which causes the Indentation to go to the next available tab stop - especially when larger font sizes are applied. By default, that tap stop is at 1' which is what causes the gap.  There are several ways to adjust it. One option is to simply use a smaller font size, but based on how you've constructed the list it seems the better way may be to: Another option would be to do as above, but as step #5 just change the Number Position to Right (or Centered) rather than Left.

"Hey Mitchell at home,   Windows Fax and Scan works with built-in and external fax modems but isn't designed to work with stand-alone fax machines or multifunction printers with fax capabilities.   Some printer manufacturers might offer drivers that allow your printer to function like a fax modem with Windows Fax and Scan.   For your product G85, there is no separate driver available.

"Hi Daisy, Welcome to Microsoft Answers!  In addition to Coork's post, you  may follow  these steps. Check if the issue persists in Safe Mode. Method 1: Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs do not run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start Windows are installed. Safe mode is useful for troubleshooting problems with programs and drivers that might not start correctly, or that might prevent Windows from starting correctly. If a problem does not reappear when you start in safe mode, you can eliminate the default settings and basic device drivers as possible causes. If a recently installed program, device, or driver prevents Windows from running correctly, you can start your computer in safe mode and then remove the program that is causing the problem. 1. Restart your computer. Click the Start button, click the arrow next to the Lock button, and then click Restart. 2. Do one of the following: ·  If your computer has a single operating system installed, press and hold the F8 key as your computer restarts. You need to press F8 before the Windows logo appears. If the Windows logo appears, you will need to try again by waiting until the Windows logon prompt appears, and then shutting down and restarting your computer. ·  If your computer has more than one operating system, use the arrow keys to highlight the operating system you want to start in safe mode, and then press F8. 3. On the Advanced Boot Options screen, use the arrow keys to highlight the safe mode option you want, and then press ENTER. Log on to your computer with a user account that has administrator rights. When your computer is in safe mode, you'll see the words Safe Mode in the corners of the display. To exit safe mode, restart your computer and let Windows start normally. If the issue does not occur in Safe mode, perform a clean boot. Method 2: Follow these steps to perform a Clean Boot. Note If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps. We strongly recommend that you do not use the System Configuration utility to modify the advanced boot options on the computer unless a Microsoft support engineer directs you to do this. Doing this may make the computer unusable. a. Log on to the computer by using an account that has administrator rights. b. Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility.If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue. c. On the General tab, click Selective Startup, and then click to clear the Load startup items check box. (The Use Original Boot.ini check box is unavailable.) d. On the Services tab, click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box, and then click Disable all. Note: Following this step lets Microsoft services continue to run. These services include Networking, Plug and Play, Event Logging, Error Reporting, and other services. If you disable these services, you may permanently delete all restore points. Do not do this if you want to use the System Restore utility together with existing restore points. e. Click OK, and then click Restart. Note: Reset the computer to start as usual After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual: a. Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue. b. On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK. c. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.

"Hi, I understand that if I want to select a text that is not next to another text I have highlighted, I would normally hold the command key (on a Mac) or the control key (on a Windows laptop).

"Hello,  I think Windows Defender does a decent job in protecting you computer from the most prevalent and widespread threats. Combined with Windows Firewall, you also get a protection from online unauthorized access to you computer and LAN protection from local networks attacks (like in open wifi zones). However, Windows Defender scores low in many AV tests given that these tests really use very sophisticated malware that are zero-day malware (Windows Defender scores very low in this category). Normal users do not typically encounter those creepy malware. Also, Windows Defender does not provide strong protection against ongoing exploits (some other security products can detect exploit activity on vulnerable apps and prevent it), so make sure you keep all you software updated, especially Windows, as Microsoft continuously provide new updates to secure you system.  Now, you are the one to decide if you need an additional security software or not. I just can give you some points to consider while deciding.  1- Are you a cautious user? This mean, for example, do you easily recognize suspicious websites or downloads or not. Or can you spot signs of infection? 2- How often do you shop online using your banking information? 3- Do you have very important data in your computer (this may sound silly :) )? 4- Do you install infamous software often? 5- Do you mind running MalwareBytes scans weekly? 6- etc...  Just understand that if you want premium protection, Windows Defender is far from being the best product, however, it provides decent protection against the most common threats. Advanced security products often offer advanced cloud protection, very impressive detection of zero-day malware (very recent unknown threats), automatic prevention from exploits, protection from fishing websites (higher than the smart screen filter)...  You choose, I think you are the only one to know if you need high protection or only a basic one. I used Windows Defender in Windows 8/ Windows 8.1 for quite some time and it did a great job protecting my system until once I realized I had a rootkit that it did not detect. I am now using another security suit.  I hope this helps.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

"I need write an Excel formula to calculate a charge rate based on the following criteria.  Note that CWT is equal to the total pounds divided by 100. 0-1710 lbs = $7 cwt 1711-3330 lbs = $6 cwt 3331 and greater = $5 cwt Example:  1500 lbs would be 1500 / 100 * $7 = $105. The only variable tracked on the spreadsheet is the total pounds; therefore, all other variables must be contained in the formula. I have tried to create a nested IF formula but can't seem to get the syntax right.   Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Huh, my nested if would be (assuming number of pounds is in cell A1): =if(A1<1711, A1*7, if(A1<3331, A1*6, A1*5)) Note that since the second if is only called if A1<=1711 you don't need to make sure it is over 1710. You could also use an IFS: =ifs(A1<1711, A1*7,A1<3331,A1*6,A1>3330,A1*5) (Ifs is a special form of if designed for several if statements to slightly reduce the amount of nesting, if will check each if in turn and return that result if true, otherwise it will go to the next if). ","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Thank you for your response  I think where I am getting tripped up is the second condition is a ""between"" so that if the pounds are between 1711 and 3330 then the amount charged per cwt is $6.  How would I account for the two conditions in the second nested IF statement? ","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
" The trick is to not think of it as between, but as a set of exclusions. Step 1, is the number less than 1711?  If yes, then *7, else go to step 2. Step 2, is the number less than 3331?  If yes then *6, else go to step 3. Step 3, *5. You see, you don't need to worry about the number being less than 1711 in step 2 because in step 1 you already removed anything less than 1711 from your list, by multiplying it by 7 and ending your if statement. I could also write the if statement the following ways: =if(A1>3330, A1*5,if(A1>1710, A1*6, A1*7)) =if(A1>3330, A1*5, if(A1<1711, A1*7, A1*6)) =if(A1<3330, if (A1>1711, A1*6, A1*7), A1*5) The latter was an attempt to check for your ""between"" first.  But if statements are not designed to worry about ""between,"" you use two ifs for that. The trick is to remember that excel follows each ""if"" rule in order, so once it has done the first task, any number affected by that if statement is not available to the later if statements.  So if you have your first question be ""is A1>3330"" then you no longer have to worry about your number being >3330, because you already dealt with all those customers with your first if.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"Hi, Welcome to Microsoft answers. I suggest you to follow the below steps: 1. Insert the DVD in the CDDVD drive. 2. Open computer, click on DVD drive, and Select the files you want to copy. To select all files, press Ctrl and A keys together, to select files randomly press Ctrl and left mouse click on the file. 3. Right click on the selected files, click on copy. 4. Select the location where you want to save those files, right click and paste it.  If you are copying the music from an audio CD, then you need to rip the music.  Here are the steps: 1.      For best results, make sure that you are connected to the Internet before you begin. When your computer is connected to the Internet, the Player attempts to retrieve media information about the tracks being ripped from an online database. The Player then adds the information to the files during ripping. Note that you can rip a CD when your computer isn't connected to the Internet. However, the Player won't be able to identify the name of the CD, the artist who created it, or the names of the songs until you go online. 2.      Insert an audio CD into the CD drive. 3.      (Optional) If you want to select a different format (for example, MP3 instead of WMA) or bit rate (for example, 192 Kbps instead of 128 Kbps) for the files created during ripping, in the Player Library, click the Rip settings menu, and then click Format or Audio Quality. 4.      (Optional) If you don't want to rip every song, in the Player Library, clear the check boxes next to the songs you don't want to rip. 5.      Click the Rip CD button in Now Playing mode or Rip CD in the Player Library to begin ripping. After the songs have been ripped, you can find and play them in the Player Library.

"SOLUTION TO BLOCKING ADVERTISEMENT: Thanks to Ellen Barry for posting this to Microsoft Sudoku page on Facebook. The solution is to change the size of Fonts and Icons (Change DPI Scaling Level). Windows ensures that everything appears on the screen at a usable and consistent size by instructing applications to resize their content by a scale factor. Most desktop monitors and notebook LCD's are usually in the range of 95-110 DPI, Windows sets a scale factor of 100% by default. When you change the DPI scaling level for your monitor, it changes the size of text, apps and other items to appear larger or smaller. A higher DPI level has everything appear larger, and a lower DPI level has everything appear smaller. Start with all apps closed, and right-click an empty area on your desktop, and click Display Settings. Click on Display on the left pane. If you have more than one display connected to your computer, then select a monitor in the right pane that you want to change the DPI of. Under Change the size of text, apps and other items, move the slider left or right to the DPI percentage you want to set for that monitor. 6. Click on Apply. 7. If the selected DPI is optimal for your usage, click on Sign out now for the settings to take effect.  My Surface Pro (1) was set to 150%. When I changed back to 100% my screen fonts all went smaller (sadly), but the game now works properly.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"Hello Heather,  We'd like to get more information regarding this so we could further check and provide a more established workaround. Any changes made to the system that might have caused the issue? And do confirm the current build your Windows 10 is running, as this information is vital for us to proceed with the investigation. (Type winver into the Cortana search box, then hit Enter.)  Taking note of the troubleshooting you've completed so far, try uninstalling, then re-installing Pain 3D, then check if the issue persists as this could be due to some file corruption when changes were made on the system. Here's how to perform said resolution:  1. Open an elevated PowerShell as administrator (type PowerShell into the Cortana search box, right-click on the said desktop app, select Run as administrator).  2. Type Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.MSPaint | Remove-AppxPackage and then hit Enter.  3. Go to Windows Store, then re-install the Paint 3D application.  Let us know if you require further assistance.

"Dear April,  Thanks for your quick reply. I've uploaded and shared a video via PM. In regard to your other questions, I can share the information publicly as follows:  I'm not sure about previous versions of PowerPoint 2016, whether the same issue occurred or not. It does not occur in PowerPoint 2011 for Mac, that is for certain. I'm also unsure what you mean about ""configuring settings""—which settings do you mean? I have applied the latest updates to Office, though, as part of the Office 365 subscription.  Yes, the identical issue occurs on a different Mac using the same file, this time with the latest version of Sierra.  I have confirmed that it doesn't matter whether I am plugged into an external display or not—the issue still occurs.

"Dear April,  Many thanks for your quick replies, and for your interest in helping to identify the problem.  I tried booting in safe mode, and then started up each helper app that typically runs in the background, one by one, to see if I could find any culprits.   Good news! I identified that whenever Moom (the OS X window management software developed by Many Tricks) was running in the background, this PowerPoint crashing issue when switching between Normal and Notes Page views would occur. When I quit Moom and attempt the same steps in PowerPoint, the problem does not occur. I'm never had issues with PowerPoint and Moom like this before, but apparently something has changed during their upgrade cycles, causing a dependency on common processes (?) to fail.   It seems strange to me that a window management app with apparently no dependencies on PowerPoint would cause issues like this when the PowerPoint view is changed, but quitting Moom does solve the problem on all of my machines, two running El Capitan (10.11.6) and one running Sierra.  I suppose the next step is to report this to Many Tricks... but I also wonder if this is not a PowerPoint issue as well.  At any rate, thanks very much for helping me to track down the problematic process. Safe boot mode and a little sleuthing did the trick!

"Hi.  I am trying to format an excel so that when I export reports it'll automatically turn the percentages into whole numbers.  For example, when I try to change 100% into a number, it automatically changes it to 1, not 100.  The process I am currently using is very tedious, so I am hoping there is a simple solution.

This should convert your percentages to numbers.   Now if you had a percentage that was 33% and it actually contained  .33333333  then this would not make that a whole number.   However, you could format the cell to not show any decimal places after you multiplied by 100.

For your example with the 33%, this is one of my big issues... what I have been doing is multiplying all of my % s by 100 in another column, then copying those values and pasting them as numbers.

"When you copy the 100, then you select the destination cell and do the paste special.

Yes it is the same thing as you do with your formula, but you don't have to created the formulas, and copy and paste all the cells, then remove the formulas.   It can be used on non-contiguous ranges and so forth.  It is a technique I use all the time with little thought or effort.

"I had to update Office and now features in PPT are gone.

"This is my first time ever asking an excel function question on this website, so forgive me if this makes little sense. I have a very large excel spreadsheet consisting of copious amounts of data. To make a really long story short, I need to eliminate all single values in one particular column in my spreadsheet. By ""single value"" I am referring to single letters, such as ""A"", ""B"", ""C"" etc. These are the middle names of the spreadsheet, and I need to get rid of them for a specific column. Because there is so much data, it is unrealistic for me to do this manually. These single value letters are in the same column as  regular word values with full last names, so I can't just delete the entire columns without getting rid of the regular names that I want to keep. So is there any kind of Excel function that allows me to delete the single values only? Thanks.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

And that to use this product you need to purchase a new key for it. Their is no reason for a product that works in the old computer perfectly, should need a new key by just moving a hard drive. same product different computer. that is like saying well all the apps on your old smartphone you bought will have to re bought for your new smartphone. this is so wrong in so many ways.

"The Cross-reference function in Word makes use of hidden bookmarks; when you create a cross-reference, Word encloses the cross-referenced item in a bookmark. The problem with bookmarks is that you can easily expand them by mistake. For example, this happens if you add text, or press Enter, at the beginning of a bookmarked paragraph. To work around this limitation, always add new paragraphs at the end of an existing paragraph.

"You can easily tell what I mean by adding a manual bookmark to a text paragraph and enable the option (in File | Options | Advanced) to show bookmarks:  [Bookmarked text.]  The brackets illustrate that the whole paragraph is bookmarked.  Now, if you click at the very beginning of the paragraph and type something, or press Enter, you'll notice that the bookmark expands to include the new content:  [ Bookmarked text.]  In other words, the bookmarked text now includes a paragraph mark. In fact, anything that you add at the beginning of a bookmarked paragraph will be added inside the bookmark. This will cause trouble when you update a cross-reference that makes use of the bookmark.  When you let Word create hidden bookmarks (and it always does when you make use of the Cross-reference function), the situation is even more tricky.

"Split from this thread. I am having the same problem!!  I have an Excel file saved on a shared MacOS server (mini).  Before upgrading to Office 365, we were on Mac Excel 2011 and didn't have any problems.  My Excel file has R&W for me as the owner and Read for everyone else.  But every time I make a change to the file, it now drops the Read access and gives ""No Access"" to everyone else.  When I go to the server and change the permissions back to Read, it stays that way until I make another change and then wipes out the Read access again.  It is consistent across Excel files--not unique to a certain one.  And Word works fine.  It doesn't change permissions on Word docs I save in the same folders.

"Hi Sandra   Welcome to Microsoft Answers!   Which is the program that you had installed which created the virtual drive?   Method 1: You may check if few of the components of that particular program is still there in Programs and Features. If it is still there you will have to remove them and then try uninstalling the Virtual drive. To remove programs from Programs and feature follow the steps.  If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation. For more information follow the link. Uninstall or change a program http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program   Method 2: If you are not able to remove the program from Programs and features try installing Windows Installer Cleanup Utility. After you have installed it and restarted the computer launch the Utility and select the program from the list given and remove it completely from the computer. Description of the Windows Installer CleanUp Utility http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290301   Method 3: Still you are not able to get rid of the virtual drive try installing the program that had come with it and then uninstall it completely from the computer.

"  Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft community.   Based on your issue description, I understand that you are having difficulties to download apps from the Windows store.   I can understand how frustrating it could be when things don't work as expected.   To understand this issue better, I would like to know the following information:   1. Which app are you trying to download from Windows store? 2. Do you get any error message when the download fails, if so what is the exact error message? 3. Do you have any issues to launch Windows store?   Let's try the following the methods and check if it helps. Method 1: Run Apps troubleshooter.   This tool can automatically identify and fix some problems with apps and the Store. It's only available in English, but will work on PCs running any language.   Apps troubleshooter http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=268423 Method 2: If the issue still persists  clear Store Cache: a. Press Windows key + R. b. Type in “WSReset.exe”. c. Press ENTER. d. Restart the computer and check. Method 3: Check if the region is correct. Follow the steps mentioned: a. Type ""Region"" on the Start screen. Click ""Settings"" and press ENTER. b. On the ""Format"" tab, select ""English (United Kingdom)"". c. Click ""Languages Preferences"" > ""Add a language"" and add ""your language"". d. Once added, select it and click ""Move Up"" to make it the first language. Close the Language window. e. On the ""Region"" window, click ""Additional Settings"" and check if the values are same. f. Click the ""Location"" tab and change the Home Location to ""your country"" and then click OK. Method 4: If you are still having issues downloading from Windows store, place the computer in clean boot and check if you are able to access Window store. A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7, or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.

"Hello I've embedded a Word document into an Excel file. Everything works great, however, it looks ugly. My main issues are: When I click on the Word file's icon, the icon shows a bounding box around it. The Word file's icon can currently be resized and repositioned anywhere in the Excel document.  So, my questions are: How do I get rid of the bounding box? Right now the embedded Word file seems to be ""hovering"" over the Excel file rather than contained within a cell.

"The direct answers to your initial 3 questions are:  A couple of points:  First & foremost: Objects cannot be inserted into cells... period. What Jessica attempted to describe as well as any other 'tutorials' you find may be well-intended but are a misrepresentation of what actually is being done. Essentially, the object can be locked into position on a sheet so that it appears to be contained within a cell. In truth, the object still floats on the surface of the sheet.  Second: Keeping the object anchored in place requires 2 conditions:  As you've found, however, with Protection enabled the object icon is rendered as a static graphic & cannot be opened.  Although it isn't exactly what you want, the only option I can suggest is to insert a Hyperlink to the document in a cell... An icon could be included as well with the Hyperlink in an adjacent cell. The Hyperlink will work even when Protection is enabled to preserve the positioning of the icon. A down side of this method, though, is that a copy of the document is not embedded in the Excel file, so a copy of the document must travel with the workbook.","[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]"

"THAT, was very nice of you to reply so quickly.  It sounds as if (based on my reading of your post) that I have everything enabled correctly. (A good thing.)  By the way ... It's not JUST the mail app tile that I am unable to find documentation for. I'm having the same issue with the MSN News, and Store apps as well. Plenty of ""how to use"" documentation available but little or no mention of the tiles.  Here's why I ask.  I recently reinstalled Windows 10 home. And everything, as far as I know, is running perfectly.  I did notice however, that the live mail tile ""seems"" to behave a bit differently than I remember it (Before the reinstall.)  IE: Used to be (methinks). If I had 10 unanswered emails, the number ""10"" would appear on the tile. If an additional email arrived, 10, would turn to 11. And it would stay at ""11"", until I opened mail and clicked on one of the 11 never opened emails. If I clicked on one(of the emails to read it) and then ended mail, the live tile would now say ""10"". I always thought that the number on the tile represented the number of ""unread"" emails in the ""In"" box. But due to the lack of documentation on the tile, I could have simply made that up.  Now (after my reinstall of Windows 10), it seems to behave differently.  As a test, I sent myself a couple of emails from my phone. The number on the Mail tile changed to ""2"". (Good, so far.) If however, I left it that way for a period of time, the number ""2"" will disappear and be replaced by no number at all. But if I open the mail app, there are indeed 2 unread emails (from my phone).  So, before crying ""wolf"" (or worrying that my reinstall of WIndows 10 went bad in some way), I thought I would try to locate and read how the mail live tile is SUPPOSED to behave.  Maybe, it is behaving correctly and either my memory is faulty (Wouldn't be the first time) or now that Windows has been reloaded and updated, I find the Win10 mail tile (by design) simply works differently. And that OKay with me. I just would like to know how it is SUPPOSED to work.  Hence my looking for documentation.  Did I write that correctly ? ..... Yes. Yes, I think I did.

"The length function for date depends on your DATE range. What is your Minimum date in that sheet? Because you have used LEN function which returns 4 or 5 or something due to Excel reads DATE as NUMBER. Every new day Excel adds 1 with last days Number. The 1-Jan-1900 date Excel reads as 1 and day after day it adding +1.  It reads your 12-Apr-1917 date as 6312. So in my opinion is, do not use LEN() to get the date, use DATE(), that is why I've asked you what is the minimum date. I'm sue that, your data validation has set a minimum date.

"Cody, with all due respect, but that goes into a completely wrong direction. Date() is used to CREATE a date value from components for year, month and day. Datevalue() is used to CREATE a datevalue from a text string. None of these functions can be used to CHECK if a cell contains a date.  SpinazRoger1, is your data validation set up so that the user gets a warning and is still allowed to enter text into the date cell? If so, consider configuring the data validation that only valid entries are allowed. This can be done by setting the data validation style to ""Stop"" on the Error Alert tab, as shown in the screenshot.    With this setting, only dates can be entered into the cell and text won't be allowed.  If, however, for some reason you do want to allow text as well, but you only want to show the result in B1 if the data entered in A1 is a date, then you can check with IsNumber() instead of Len() in your IF statement.   Of course, since all dates are stored as numbers internally, the user could just type in a number, and if that number falls within the date range you allowed in the data validation settings, then the IsNumber function would also return TRUE.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

If the issue still occurs, please provide the following information: 1. Can you open Word application? If Yes, when you create a new document, does the issue occur? Does the issue occur to all the existing documents? What are their common features (file format e.g. .doc, the application version that created the documents and so on)? 2. What actions have you performed before the issue occurred for the first time? For example, a system update and a software installation. Does the issue occur right after the upgrade? 3. Detailed steps and related screenshots (error messages) about how you encounter the issue. Do you double click to open documents?  4. Your Mac OS version (e.g. 10.12.4) and Word version. For Mac OS version, from the Apple menu, choose About This Mac. The version number appears beneath “macOS” or “OS X.” For your Word version, choose Word in the top menu bar > About Word and please capture a screenshot of the window.

"Hi Susan,  When you mentioned by ""I try to use different language on my powerpoint, including system and font"", do you mean want to change the language for user interface (menu items, buttons, or other interface elements)?  A.   If so, I'd like to explain that we don't install language package to change the language in Office for Mac. Since the Office for Mac user interface are dynamically based on your operating system preferences, so we can change the language of your operating system to change the language in Office for Mac. Please refer to the steps in this article: Change the language of Office 2016 for Mac programs by changing the system language.  B.   Or are you trying to change the spelling and grammar language?

If so, I'd like to explain that the language list under Tools>Language is for Proofing tools.

I have a load of important information on this drive and it is driving me mad........ any ideas on how to remove this password?????  Original title: BitLocker password ,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"Hi,  Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.  I understand your concern and would like to inform you that to unlock your drive, you will need either the Bitlocker password or the Bitlocker Recovery key. While enabling Bitlocker, you get the option to create a password/key and a recovery file. If you had saved the recovery file somewhere, you can still decrypt but  I am really sorry to say that if you do not remember any of these, then we’ll be not be able to help you further due to Security reasons.  You may go through the following Microsoft article to get more information: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/unlock-bitlocker-protected-drive  http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/bitlocker-drive-encryption  See also: https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh831507.aspx#BKMK_bltgunlock  Write to us if you need assistance with Windows in future. We’ll be glad to help.","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Attempt to find the Bitlocker Recovery Key. If you printed it out, look through your personal paperwork. If you saved it on a computer or another drive, do a search for files with ""Bitlocker"" in the name. If you think you might have written the password down then you can look for that too.  If you are unable to find the recovery key then you have two remaining options. One is to try and crack the Bitlocker password. If you did things properly this won't work - the whole *point* of Bitlocker is it can't be cracked - but if you used a weak password it might. It's not a topic I know about in detail and it probably shouldn't be discussed on Microsoft Answers anyway.  The second is to run a data recovery tool on any other computers or drives you have, and hope that you or your programs saved copies of the files on there in the past. PhotoRec is my usual choice, http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec . To use it you will need *another* external drive with lots of free space.

From here the normal trouble shooting process is: - do an Office Repair, - uninstall Office from Control Panel > Programs and Features, - uninstall Office using Fix It tool You test to see if problem is fixed between steps. The first step just ""refreshes"" your program code. There should be no impact on your setup The second step re-installs Office while keeping all of your current customizations, macros etc. Again, no impact.

"Hi DJ: My name is Ron. Yes, having too many unused styles in the document complicates it. And can lead to document corruption. I have several documents I collect info from the web into. They are constantly adding unused styles that I clean up. Actually, it is a 2 step process. First delete unused styles, then I go through remaining ""extra"" styles and apply my standard styles before deleting the now unused style. Here are some macros you can play with to find one that works best for you: DETERMINING HOW MANY STYLES ARE AVAILABLE http://word.tips.net/T000803_Determining_How_Many_Styles_are_Available.html Summary: Got a macro that processes or uses styles? You definitely need to know how many styles Word has available in the document. Use the Count property of the Styles collection to determine the figure. FINDING UNUSED STYLES http://word.tips.net/T001488_Finding_Unused_Styles.html Summary: Use this VBA macro to determine which styles are being used in the current Word document. REMOVING UNUSED STYLES http://word.tips.net/T001337_Removing_Unused_Styles.html Summary: Got an older document that has a bunch of unused styles defined in it? You can get rid of those styles easily by using the short macro in this tip DELETE UNUSED STYLES (TAKE 2) http://word.mvps.org/faqs/numbering/RemoveManualNumbers.htm This macro below and at this site is excellent but I notice it does not exactly remove all manually Outlined Numbered paragraphs which have been converted to Normal or Plain text - Like any ""Article"" heading or even A., B., numbering for certain paragraphs. However, it does remove 1.1, (a), etc. numbering which I find odd. DELETE UNUSED STYLES (TIP) The use of Style.Delete is not the best way to go. If multiple styles are deleted by the loop the time taken blows out exponentially and will typically be 30 minutes to delete 100 styles. Instead use: Application.OrganizerDelete Source:= ActiveDocument.Path & ""\"" & ActiveDocument.Name, _ Name:=oStyle.NameLocal, Object:=wdOrganizerObjectStyles It will then take only a few seconds to delete 100 or more styles. I have a few more (long) macros that don't have links if the above ones don't do it for you. Bonus: STYLE REPORT ADD-IN http://gregmaxey.mvps.org/word_tip_pages/style_report_addin.html With Style Report, users can quickly loop through the style collection and with the user interface provided make a decision to keep or delete the styles used in a document or previously used styles that are not applied to any text. With finished, Style Report summarized user actions and reports style status.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

If I remove the XLA & start a brand new VBA project, the DLL is still not listed as an available reference. I know I can register the dll myself but the excel addin is meant for external clients. So I would need to register this dll when it is installed (to me, this should be done by office). So I would like to know: - Is the dll even registered? (I can find it in the registry editor but does that mean its registered?) - If not why not? (If office 2010 installs this DLL, then why not simply register it?)

"I have a series of PowerPoint presentations that are essentially troubleshooting guides with shapes that link to work instructions, videos, etc. that are contained in other slides.  They are on the larger side (between 50 and 200MB) and have a few hundred slides each. The presentations are stored in a OneDrive for Business folder.  When I try to view them using PowerPoint Online, the pages load very slowly when I click on a link, and occasionally the program times out and crashes.

Hi Melissa  Thank you for the quick reply.  Office 365. Currently version 1707 is on my other computers so I can only guess that is what was on the computer with the problem.  The problem is not file specific.    If I click on an Excel file in Windows Explorer it takes 30 seconds to start/open. If I have Excel open but use Windows Explorer to find the file I is very quick. If I open a file within Excel it is very quick. The problem lies within the ability to start Excel from Windows Explorer and has nothing to do with the files.  My complaint was that the repair function completely deleted all my Office apps!!!. I had to reinstall Office 365 from scratch. I am now on version 1708 and Excel and files open quickly.  The advice to repair is wrong until the repair function is fixed. Advice to delete and reinstall Office is correct but a nuisance.   I assume all the computers will automatically upgrade to version 1708     ,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Insider Slow and general release are monthly. Insider Slow comes out about week before general release and is usually the same build.  Right now, the 15.39 Insider Fast build has a peculiarity where everything in Excel is upside down and mirrored in Sierra and High Sierra.

"I am having a few problems while trying to animate individual cells of a table in PowerPoint 2007. I need the text of each cell to appear separately, on click. I am following the instructions as given here.  The problem is that my table contains text in both English and the Devanagari script (font - Mangal).

"Hi! I have an Excel spreadsheet that I want to use to calculate/sum time. I have four columns (also a screenshot is posted below!); 1. Time Start 2. Time End 3. Total DAY Hours 4. Total NIGHT Hours  So what I do is that I put a time in time start column and a time in time end column. So in the day column, if I do ""Time End - Time Start"" (using cell references obviously), I succuessfully get my total hours/minutes. However, my problem is that all of that time goes inside the day column...So how can I get Excel to put any hours/time AFTER 7PM and UNTIL 5AM to be inside the NIGHT Column?  Here is an image of my spreadsheet; as you can see, I was testing it, it works though, but it cares for all time as day (obviously as I put it in day, but I would like to divide this!)  So for example, say if I put Start Time as: 3:00PM and End Time as 9:00PM. What I would like to happen is that, any time before 6PM is in day so I would want the sum to be; 3 Hours in DAY Column and then the remaining 3 Hours in Night (as any hours after 6PM is declared as night).

I'll post it below incase someone else ever needs something similar;  Formula for day: =IF(L3>O$3,IF(K3>O$3,0,O$3-K3),L3-K3) Formula for night: =IF(L3>O$3,IF(K3>O$3,L3-K3,L3-O$3),0)  *The second IF statement inside the main IF statement was added as when my Time Start was after 6PM, the formula returned negative values as it summed from 6PM-an integer greater than 6; thus negative values.

How do I get subtotals.  I can't tell it to subtotal after the change in name because there may be 11 blanks space under the name. Example:  John Doe                   123                                    234                                    345                                    456                                    567 Jane Doe                    987                                    876                                    765                                    654 How do i get a subtotal for John and Jane?

"I open up a new, blank presentation and use View, Slide Master to enter the slide master view. The left side thumbnail pane displays the various layouts in the slide master.

That switches the view to Outline, but also permanently hides the layout thumbnails when I switch back to Slide Master view.

"So I know I should do this via template - there are a couple of reasons why I don't so I won't get into it here. My question is if I have a nice background in an image format, let's say it's 6MB. IF I copy that SAME image (it doesn't even have to be a background, it could be a logo) 100x in a deck, does it increase the size proportionally, or is Office storing an XML link to it internally and stores it once.

"I can't give you an absolute answer because you haven't indicated which release of the program you're using... There could be some degree of difference based on that.  In PPt 2016, it depends on how you insert the Background: The same would hold true for a template... there's nothing to be gained in this respect. It's a matter of how the file/template is built.  Just one piece of friendly advice, on the subject :-) IMHO there is absolutely no justification for using images of that size in PPt presentations, whether as backgrounds or otherwise.

Does the size of the presentation file increase <trump>bigly</trump> or just a little bit?  In the Windows versions of PPT, for quite a few versions back, if you insert an image once then copy/paste it to other slides within the same presentation, PPT stores only one instance of the image and points to it from the other slides.  It actually even tries to do this when you insert the image several times (via Insert | Picture).  If it figures out that you've inserted an existing pic a second time, it uses the original.  I'd be quite surprised if the Mac version doesn't do the same thing (at least the current version).

"For several years, I have had a Powerpoint File that has several graphs that are linked to data and graphs in an Excel file.  Formerly, I could update the Excel File, which updates the graphs, and all graphs update when I open the Powerpoint file. Before 2016, I could ""COPY"" a graph, then ""Paste Special"" using ""Keep Source Formatting and Link Data option.  Graphs would update as data was changed in Excel or at least when the PPT file was opened.  When a ""Right-Click"" was done on the graph in PPT, there was an ""Update Link"" option.    Sometime during 2016, existing graphs update in PPT, but new graphs do not.  The ""COPY"", ""Paste Special"", ""Keep Source Formatting and Link Data"" option still appears normal, but now, the ""Update Link"" command is not active in Powerpoint, and the only way to update more than ONE graph in PPT is to go to Excel, and copy and paste each graph in place of the old one.

"Hello, I am currently using Office365 ProPlus with a current Version 1705 (Build 8201.2102 Click-to-Run) under Windows 7. We use a PowerPoint AddIn to add extensive functions to PowerPoint. With the current version one function in our AddIn has stopped working and throws an error. The same function works fine in PowerPoint Version 1701 (sorry, don't have the exact Build number). What the AddIn is trying to do is adding a Tab Stop within the cell of a table. I already found out that the Tab Stop works fine with regular text fields. The problem only occurs within a table. Can anybody else confirm this problem? Is this a known bug and it's being worked on? Or is this an intended behavior? If so, is there a workaround for this? I can still manually (so not with VBA) add a tab stop to a cell, so in general PowerPoint still offers this functionality. If you want to check this behavior in your version, first create an empty new presentation. Change the layout to ""Empty"". Add a text field and name it ""text"" in the selection and visibility pane. Add a table (1 column, 2 rows) and name it ""table"". Afterwards you can add this code: Option Explicit                         Public Sub TabStopsTest()     Dim pres As Presentation     Dim shpTable As Shape     Dim shpText As Shape      On Error GoTo errhandler      Set pres = ActivePresentation     Set shpTable = pres.Slides(1).Shapes(""table"")     Set shpText = pres.Slides(1).Shapes(""text"")      'this works for a normal text field     shpText.TextFrame.Ruler.TabStops.Add ppTabStopRight, 200      'but throws an error within a table     shpTable.Table.Cell(1, 1).Shape.TextFrame.Ruler.TabStops.Add ppTabStopRight, 200      'however, changing the text within the cell works correctly     shpTable.Table.Cell(1, 1).Shape.TextFrame.TextRange.Text = ""test""     Exit Sub errhandler:     MsgBox Err.Number & "": "" & Err.Description, vbOKOnly End Sub Thanks in advance for any insight to this problem.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

"I've got a list of products that each have different categories in columns that I would like to chart as they came out each year (also in a separate column). For example, one category has fashion and sport options. I would like to show how many fashion items came out each year and how many sport items came out each year. I've got a number of these categories that I would like to make separate charts for. It would be an excessive amount of work to add these categories up.

"Hi, Facebook Gameroom app has been working fine up until this morning which coincidentally was just after the last major update of Win 10 to version 1709.

" Your suggestion was helpful because I started to look at my problem from a different perspective, and so it was looking at the ""animation"" that I thought about the audio tracks as being ""animation"" too.  Williexcept, I discovered it was the voice and music tracks that were not trimmed that caused the slides not to progress to the next slide.  It was due to a music track being longer than the voice track which ran beyond both by playing on with the longer background music track. After I trimmed both to match, there was no problem with slide sequence progression.

how to auto fill in sequence numbering on a filtered data excel spreadsheet?,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
" You can do this if you have a range that is NOT an Excel table. If you are using a table, you need to convert it to a range first.  Filter the range Select the cells where you want the auto-numbering to go, for example the visible cells in column B, starting in the first visible row below the header  hit F5 > Special > Visible cells only > OK If the first visible row of data is in row 43, enter this formula into B43 -- but don't hit Enter yet!  =MAX($B$1:B42)+1  The formula refers to all rows above. In this example, row 43 is the first visible data row in the filtered range, so the formula refers to rows 1 to 42.  Hold down the Ctrl key and hit Enter. The formula will now be applied to all the visible cells.  Now you can remove the filter to see that the consecutive numbering has only been applied to the rows that you had previously showing.  Does that help?  cheers, Lori","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

Next:  When working on the file, ALWAYS open from/save to a copy of the file on your local hard drive.  Never open from/save to files on removable storage (thumb drives, etc). Copy the file from removable storage to your hard drive, open it from there, save it, then move it back to removable storage if need be.

I just started using PP 2016 for MAC, and have only created two files; one was an earlier saved version of the same PP file (just in case). Both files became corrupted. They are stored locally, on my internal hard drive, not on a peripheral drive or on off-site server. 2. When do you encounter this issue, after some Office or Mac OS updates? No MAC OS updates occurred and I'm pretty sure PP was not updated. I was just working on the files. I have a 500GB internal drive, which is down to 45GB, and I thought maybe that affected it.

"Split from this thread. This might be a stupid question, but if I show Word Preferences to use centimeters as the system of measurements and I enter the conversion of 3/4"" to 1.91 cm and 1/2"" to 1.27 cm would that not then cause the margins to replicate the original margins of 3/4 and 1/2? Or, because Word 2016 is programmed differently it won't matter; it'll still spread my book out anyway? What's your suggestion to best replicate my original settings? I'm really trying to avoid having to reformat every page to a variety of font sizes I don't want. Just to fit the same text on a page I shouldn't have to reformat part to 12 point size text and another to 11 WHEN ORIGINALLY it was all formatted to 13 point and fit PERFECTLY. I hope I'm not wearing out my welcome with so many questions... Thanks","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"Hi Jim: My name is Ron. No it is not a stupid question, just a question. To the best of my knowledge, yes, doing the conversion you describe should result in the same margins. Have you tried it and encountered a problem ?","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"What may be a key factor: Imperial to Metric often is not an exact equivalent in most software due to rounding. For example, .5"" does convert to 1.27 cm, but .75"" converts to 1.9 cm because the absolute conversion value is 1.905 cm.  Changing the margin to 1.91 cm (especially if done for both top & bottom or both sides) in an existing document can be enough to cause the text flow problem.  If you want to change the measurement system in an existing document it's best to to accept the conversion done by the program. In most cases the text flow will not be altered significantly, if at all.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"Did you set the hard disk mode to IDE?  In order to install Windows XP on the partition you created, you will need to boot into your BIOS and set the hard disk mode to IDE. -------------------------------------------- After you have set the hard disk IDE mode, you can proceed to install Windows XP on the partition you created; Insert your Windows XP CD, then restart your computer. When prompted to boot from the CD, do so. This requires pressing any key on your keyboard. Windows XP will go through its setup process. Once you arrive at the Welcome Setup, press Enter on your keyboard to begin the setup process Press F8 on your keyboard to accept the license agreement Select the partition Select Format the partition using the NTFS file system Press F on your keyboard to begin the formatting. Installation files will now be copied to your hard disk Your system will be restarted, Windows XP setup will continue ---------------------------------------------- After Windows XP installs successfully, you will not be able to boot into Windows 7. This is where the recovery disc for Windows 7 comes in. 1. Put the Windows 7 Recovery disc installation disc into the disc drive, and then start the computer. 2. Press a key when the message indicating ""Press any key to boot from CD or DVD …"". appears. 3. Select a language, a time, a currency, and a keyboard or another input method, and then click Next. 4.

Type sfc /scannow, and then press ENTER. -------------------------------------------- After you have repaired your Windows 7 installation and try to boot it, you will notice that Windows 7 does not boot. Boot into the BIOS again and set the hard disk mode to SATA. You will now be able to boot into Windows 7 again. ------------------------------------------- After doing that, download EasyBCD and add a boot entry for Windows XP to the Windows 7 boot manager; EasyBCD by NeoSmart Technologies would be your answer, it provides a graphical front end to the BCDEdit Command line that makes it easy for you to define start-up settings and edit boot entries on the new Windowsboot manager. http://neosmart.net/dl.php?id=1 ------------------------------------------ The next step now is make it possible for Windows 7 to boot in IDE mode. Here are the instructions for doing that: http://www.vistax64.com/general-discussion/271218-switch-ahci-ide-tutorial-howto.html Welcome all , so let me explain I installed Windows 7 With AHCI set from Bios , but after that i wanted to use ide (becose it boots faster) and when i set Ide from Bios , the windows 7 loading screan camed upp and BSOD (Blue screen of death) with an error code 0x0000005B , i tryed the regedit trick by setting in the ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESystemCurrentControlSetServicesMsahci"" and then in the right pan the START value from 0 i set it to 1 and it supposed to be working but it was a failiure , it still did the Bsod and i was so pissed of , i wanted to make it work ... AND I DID IT !  Here are the pases : 1) I assume u have installed Windows Vista or Windows 7 with AHCI set from BIOS ! 2) Download my registry fix (to add the ide keys to regeditor) simply apply the key 3) Now the manually regedit part Go to :  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE_System_CurrentControlSet_Services_Msahci HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE_System_CurrentControlSet_Services_iaStor HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE_System_CurrentControlSet_Services_iaStorV  And in thease three keys in the right pan u will find a key named ""START"" change at all three (Msahci,iaStor,iaStorV) values from 0 To 1 Now navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE_System_CurrentControlSet_Services_PciIde ,then change the start value to ""0""    4) Now u are allmost done , restart your computer/laptop , and go to Bios and set from AHCI to IDE !!! , save settings in Bios and restart  5)Windows will be loading , and VOILA !!! NO BSOD !!! , windows Vista/Seven will install new Ide drivers and u will see in windows device manager that you dont have AHCI drivers anymore , u have Ide drivers ! 6)It will prompt for another restart , just restart it and u will be happy ---------------------------------  The first option I would recommend, if you really need to run Windows XP is to use Windows Virtual PC with Windows XP Mode, you will need to upgrade to Windows 7 Professional or Ultimate in order to gain access to Windows XP Mode.

"Hi Kings: My name is Ron. This appears to be an error code associated with upgrades, more than updates. There are several possible fixes mentioned #1 - Disable all Antimalware and firewalls, especially 3rd part ones. Make sure they are turned back on after the update is done. Try running the update. If that didn't work try #2 - restart all Windows services associated with Windows Update: - in Start Menu search for ""CMD"" - right click on it and select ""Run as Administrator"" - in the ""Command Prompt"" window enter the following commands one at a time net stop bits net stop wuauserv net stop appidsvc net stop cryptsvc - enter the following commands to rename the update install folders Ren %systemroot%SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak Ren %systemroot%system32catroot2 catroot2.bak (wait a while after the fix is complete and you are sure it is working, then come back and delete these folders, which at that point are just wasting space.) - restart the update services net start bits net start wuauserv net start appidsvc net start cryptsvc Now try update As well, this is a ""voodoo fix"".

"Hello,  Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.  From the issue description, I understand that you want to know how to reset the indexing options to its original location. The index requires almost no maintenance. However, if the index can't find a file that you know exists in an indexed location, you might need to rebuild the index. Rebuilding the index can take several hours, and searches might be incomplete until the index is fully rebuilt. Follow the below steps to rebuild the indexing. Note: As confirmed by Leslie ""Cmdr"" Keene [MVP] replied on November 11, 2014, the indexing folder would automatically rebuild to is default location is C:ProgramDataMicrosoft  And the folder ProgramData would be hidden, you will have to unhide the ProgramData folder to view the files and folders within ProgramData. Please follow the below steps to unhide the hidden folder, Note: Make sure you undo the changes after performing the troubleshooting steps.  Hope the above information was helpful, kindly get back to us if you need any further assistance.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

"So, there have been some other threads about my travails with my email system. I'm in the process of finally, I thought, getting to a point I could live with it. To refresh, a new W7Pro installation, a new WLM12 installation, and an import project from a couple of different sources.  I successfully transferred the most important files, and redid subfolders such that I could find stuff, new and old, again. But today, things were getting worse than it has been in the few days prior, which is to say that WLM ""not responding"" happens more and more, and, today, after a restart (which seems to work for a while, usually), my ENTIRE tree was empty.  That is, all my accounts (there are 4 that I have, two of which are not checked any more) had nothing in any of the folders, and my outbox location had moved back to the bottom of all those, when I'd not long ago moved it to between my primary account and the 'quick views' - which ALSO had nothing showing other than what emails had just come in on the reload's automatic checking. Not panicking yet, I went to the storage folder.  Ha!  It's all there (or seems to be).  Except, for example, my drafts, which have stuff going back nearly 20 years, now has no date older than a month ago, with the vast bulk being 10 days ago's date. Well, that's a nuisance, but liveable.  So, I go about (again!!!) importing all that; I presume that I will then laboriously have to move all of those folders and sub folders from some storage file back up to where I can actually conveniently access them. But wait!  The drafts folder, all 901 entries, has now been emptied.  I have no idea, as it's still in the laborious process of moving all 36GB back into the folder or whatever it's called that will allow me to see them in my WLM when I open it (rather than seeing some encoding which has no relationship - and now, not even a date - with what I can look for), whether that's a display anomaly, or that importing them (which I presume will show those in some other folder name when I again examine the WLM store folder) actually takes them  out of the source folder, or if the problem somehow is with my W7Pro file manager. This is beyond distressing, as my very extensive and time-consuming reconstruction of my email information just went belly up. Would a restore to an earlier date cure that issue (that is, give me my email folders as I had it earlier this morning), without losing the work I've done in the meantime? I'm very nervous, as my email is basically my life's story, and all of my various charitable projects, and the rest of it, and this is just the icing on the cake of the various other issues which have shown up in these forums. So, to summarize: WLM has been locking up frequently.  A restart usually makes it work again for a while. There is, most of the time, some time spent 'restoring the database' or some such similar message before it actually opens again. The last time I did that, ALL of my current folders were empty.  All of the accounts I had, all of the laboriously reconstructed prior files in the storage folder, message rules and the like, all were gone. Inspection of the Message Store file (via windows explorer or whatever means lets me open a folder directly) showed that under a different name, all of the missing folders were present, albeit with mangled dates in some cases. Importing all of those is currently under way (at 36 or so GB, it will take a long time), but in at least one case, drafts, that folder (in the message store folder) is empty. That is, it's as though someone highlighted all and pushed the delete button.  The file exists, right where it was before, but now all 901 items are gone. I have no idea what's causing all this.  I have a new PS, MOBO, quad-core brain, 1T new 7200RPM drive, and NO other programs that I use give me any grief.  WLM seems to give me endless grief. So, would restoration (assuming some of my many restarts actually set a restore point) to earlier today put it all back together? and Without having to be an Outlook or some other web-based Microsoft client, is there some other email client which can replace WLM12?  I've been using essentially the same thing since OE, which is why I have drafts (where I keep stuff I want to refer to often) all the way back to 1995 (or, at least, I used to have them...).

"Thanks for the link.  In it I saw: Are there any recommended alternatives?  Perhaps that explains why my laptop, which is a W10 OS-based system, is stable (or, at least, it's not ever crashed on me).  It's been long enough that I no longer recall, but I *believe* I downloaded WLM12 there before importing my email system from the then-XP based system I have at my desk.  It may be that I didn't notice and the at-the-time 8.0, upgraded to 8.1 and accidentally upgraded to 10 OS had the Mail cited above .  But it doesn't explain why I should have (now a total of 4, the latest being yesterday) total crashes.  That is, I get (which is very frequent, but not always crash-inducing) ""WLM did not shut down correctly"" or some variant, along with some variant of checking, restarting, recovering the database, or the like, the latest of which presented me with all of the standard directories under my name, all empty, and none of the sub-folders I'd so laboriously filled, again.  I've ""repaired"" (the process in the control panel which takes quite a while to accomplish) WLM12 several times, but if it helped, it doesn't ""stick"" and I'm facing another crash.  I have some difficulty believing that W7Pro, so stable that legions have resisted upgrading to 10, is the cause of these crashes.  Previously, in XP, I'd lose the general mailbox that I put all the 4 accounts I monitor into, but the independent 4 accounts all survived, frequently (see prior discussions under my name). This is far worse.  Aside from resigning myself to future laborious rescue missions (I can ""usually"" - it's so fragmented that after 4 reconstructions, I'm not really sure - find the emails and rebuild my directories), is there anything I can do to minimize the likelihood of recurrence?  Failing that, is there some other program which can provide the look and feel of Outlook Express and its successors without having to ditch W7Pro?  Thanks.

"Hi,  This could be due to any corruption in system files or any third party software conflict. Try the steps below and check.  Step 1: Start the computer in safe mode and check the behavior  Safe mode is a troubleshooting option for Windows that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started. The words Safe Mode appear in the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you're using.  a. When you hit the power button, hold down the Shift key when clicking the Restart button. b. The next screen will present you with three options. Click Troubleshoot. c. Next, hit Advanced options followed by Windows Startup Settings from the next screen. d. Your PC will now be rebooted to enable the advanced parameters, which include Safe Mode as well.  Step 2:  If the issue does not persist in safe mode, place the computer in clean boot state to avoid any third party software conflict.  To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a ""clean boot."" A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.  Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.  How to perform a clean boot in Windows          Note: Refer ""How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.

"Hi,  I can certainly understand your frustration. However, make sure the right network adapter is being used. Some computers might have multiple network adapters. For example, if you bought a new desktop computer and during the purchase you upgraded to a different network adapter, you most likely have an onboard network adapter (a network adapter built onto your computer's motherboard) as well as a secondary network adapter inserted into an available slot in the computer. You can verify this by looking for two network ports on the back of your computer. (Network ports look like large phone jacks.) Laptops normally have just one network port unless you’re using a USB network adapter.  Follow these steps to check and set the correct network adapter as default.  To set the default network adapter:  1. Open Network Connections by swiping in from the right edge of the screen, tapping Search (or if you're using a mouse, pointing to the upper-right corner of the screen, moving the mouse pointer down, and then clicking Search), entering Network Connections in the search box, tapping or clicking Settings, and then tapping or clicking View network connections. 2. If multiple network adapters are installed, the default adapter will have a check mark and be labeled ""Default"". 3. If the correct network adapter is listed as disabled, press and hold or right-click it, and then tap or click Enable. 4. If the wrong network adapter is listed as the default, press and hold or right-click the correct adapter, and then tap or click Set as Default Connection.  Make sure the network adapter is enabled:  1. Open Network Connections by swiping in from the right edge of the screen, tapping Search (or if you're using a mouse, pointing to the upper-right corner of the screen, moving the mouse pointer down, and then clicking Search), entering Network Connections in the search box, tapping or clicking Settings, and then tapping or clicking View network connections. 2. Press and hold or right-click the network adapter, and then tap or click Enable.  You might be asked for an admin password or to confirm your choice.   Note: If the network adapter isn’t working properly, you might need to download and install the latest driver for it. (If you received an installation disc with the network adapter or with your computer, the driver might also be on the disc.)  Run the following trouble shooters mentioned in the below link:  a. Network Troubleshooter. b. Internet connections Troubleshooter. c.

There are a few simple things you can do to see if the problem is with your battery, your charger, or the connection (power port) on your motherboard.   a.     You’ll want to first remove the battery from your laptop. b.     Then verify the wall outlet you are using is fully functional with another electronic device. c.     Then connect your power cable to the charger, sometimes referred to as the brick, while inspecting the cable for any damage or exposed wires. d.     Then connect the charger to your laptop’s power port. e.     Power the computer on when using strictly AC power. f.     If your computer is working as intended then your battery is most likely headed for “battery heaven” and will need to be replaced.   If your computer does not work then there may be an issue with the charger or the power port on your computer. You will want to double-check all connections, and the power source (wall outlet) you are using. If the problem persists this may be a sign of a faulty charger or the computers power port.   You will also want to check the port on the computer, were your power cable plugs-in, ensuring that the power pin is not bent or damaged. If the issue appears to be with the cable you will need to obtain another cable for testing purposes. If the issue appears to be with the power port you will want to contact your computer manufacture for further assistance.

I use Windows 7. My HP P1102w printer assigned to a USB port has been printing for a couple of years.  It suddenly stopped. I have tried deleting and uninstalling the software and reinstalling it from the HP site three times without success.  I followed all of the instructions regarding when to plug in the power and USB cables.   The power comes on.  The printer shows in Devices and Printers.   Troubleshooting does not reveal a problem. I have checked the HP site and could not find a solution.   I used HP Print and Scan Doctor.  Nothing comes up. I used Malware Bytes to see if there was anything.  Nothing. I used Wise Registry Cleaner to see if it would clean superfluous registry entries.  No change. I checked the cable connections multiple times and even changed USB ports.  Nada. Anyone have any thoughts about this? Thank you! Daniel,"[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]"

"If you can print a test page from the printer, at least the printer's hardware seems to be functioning.  When you mentioned that you can't print a test page from within ""Device Manager"" do you really mean from the ""Devices and Printers"" window?  That is, the usual method for printing test pages is to right-click on a printer's icon in ""Devices and Printers,"" select ""Printer properties"" and use the ""Print test page"" button from the ""General"" tab of the ""Printer properties"" dialog.  The HP LaserJet Pro p1102 is one of HP's lower-cost ""host-based printers.""  This means that the computer itself is used to perform all of the print processing.  I'm not very familiar with this type of printer, but I'll try to help you out.  Open Devices and Printers If you go to Control Panel > Programs and Features (click Start, type Programs and Features in the Search box, and press Enter), what HP software is listed there?  Although you didn't specifically say so, it sounds as if you have at least one other printer installed on this computer.  Is that an HP printer also?  Microsoft used to have an automated ""Fixit"" routine that solved a great many printer problems.  The article describing the Fixit is still online at https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2793718/you-experience-print-spooler-error-messages-after-installing-or-upgrad  Like much of Windows 7 support, however, Microsoft ""retired"" this Fixit, as you will see if you click the buttons on that page.  Fortunately, the ""guts"" of that routine were saved by the Microsoft Print Team and are still available, although things are not quite as automated as they once were.   The Fixit has two modes, Light and Full.  Although I suspect that the Light mode will not fix your problem, it won't adversely affect your system and you may want to try it while I'm waiting for your response to the above questions.  The Full mode may well solve your problem although it's primarily intended for the more usual printer-based printing problems.  I haven't used it on a system with a host-based printer, but it should work here as well.  The catch with the Full mode, however, is that it removes all printers, even those that are now working properly.  All printers would have to be freshly installed.  That's one of the reasons I asked if you had other printers installed.  Here are directions to using the Fixit  (note that if you don't include a parameter such as -light after the name of the script, you'll get a full description of what the script does in both light and full modes):   ","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"I just got in to work about 45 minutes ago.  I did follow your instructions.  I also checked what was in the print queue AGAIN.  There were three HP Laser Jet P1102w printers shown.  One was ghosted with an exclamation point.  One was clear with an exclamation point.  One was listed as Copy 3.  I checked the queues for the two that weren't ghosted, although I had done that multiple times yesterday.  There were documents there which weren't there yesterday and I canceled them.  Low and behold, the printer, Copy 3, prints!!  I just went to Devices and Printers again to make sure that the information that you requested was still valid.

Also see post #4 here: https://www.sevenforums.com/drivers/229868-ghost-printer-devices-printers-i-can-not-remove.html  HP's ""Smart Install"" was a feature built into the firmware of some printers, including the P1102w).  If you connected a printer with ""Smart Install"" by a USB cable to an Internet-connected computer, the computer would automatically go to HP's servers, find, download, and install the correct driver.  HP disabled the servers that supported Smart Install ... but apparently printers with this feature sometimes keep trying anyway unless Smart Install is disabled.  See the first article above for details.  If you don't have the CD that came with the printer, the Smart Install Control Utility is still downloadable from: https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservice/swdetails/hp-laserjet-pro-p1102-printer-series/4110394/model/4110303/swItemId/lj-129224-1  If you get bothered by looking at ""Copy 3"" as part of the printer's name, you can right-click on the icon in Devices and Printers, select ""Printer properties"" and rename it on the ""General"" tab.

"Hi,  A DNS server is a computer server that has a directory of domain names, and translates them to IP addresses allowing you to properly browse the web and visit the websites that you want. The reason why you're experiencing this WiFi issue is probably because the DNS server isn't able to find the correct IP addresses that's associated with the host names when you try to go online on the affected computer.

"Hello, I have a Toshiba Satellite L75D-A7280 with a tsstcorp cddvdw su-208bb CD/DVDRW drive running Windows 8.1.  The drive is practically a brand new and has only been used a handful of times, but I noticed the other day that it will not recognize DVD-9's, i.e. Dual-layered DVDs.  Single layer DVD's and CD's do not seem to have any problems.  I have also successfully burned single layer DVD's using this drive.  Drivers are up to date, BIOS is up to date.  I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the drive via the Device Manager, still with no luck.  Anyone out there with some insight to this issue would be greatly appreciated as I am very frustrated with what appears to be a relatively new product malfunctioning out of the box.  Thank you.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"@Kevin K, I don't believe that has anything to do with the question being asked. As far as I know, this is a universal problem with Windows since the beginning and remains in Windows 10. Windows does not store Windows sizes. If you change your screen resolution so that the it's too small for existing windows, they will resize down to fit. Then, when you restore to the other higher resolution, the windows don't change. They ONLY change if the resolution is too small for them.  This also occurs in tablet mode when moving between landscape and portrait, because the previously long dimension becomes only the width of the new short dimension. For example, if you have a 2520x1440 screen in landscape, and have a window that's about 2,000 pixels across, then rotate to portrait mode, it will be resized down to 1440 or less pixels (often less because it may keep the upper left point at the same place, meaning the remaining width to the edge of the screen is even shorter).  This is fine and reasonable for changing resolutions. The problem is that the windows don't restore when reverting to the prior resolution. I have never seen it work they way we would expect on any system (have not checked a Surface Pro, maybe it's finally fixed there). Definitely not a function of having the latest drivers, at least not in most cases.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]"
" I think the way the original problem was described isn't addressed by a driver issue.    Basically, if I have a window open (custom sized, not maximized), and I switch between portrait and landscape mode -- the screen will shrink to fit the portrait view, but will not return to the original size when rotated back to landscape view.    Especially more annoying, is that the window doesn't need to be visible -- any open applications (minimized) also get resized to fit portrait, but not resized to the original size when rotating back to landscape view.    I suspect this would be a feature request (because I can't find any setting that would yield this behavior -- and it means it'll likely never be implemented.)  It's extremely annoying, particularly because I often have a dozen or so apps open, and when I rotate, all of them are resized.  ","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]"

Instead of navigating through the Start menu, you can setup a keyboard shortcut to the application.     Now all you have to do is press the shortcut key you created, and the Calculator will appear. If you want to delete the keyboard shortcut, open the file properties dialog box click the box next to 'Shortcut key', and press the Delete key.   Hope this helps.

(Also update the BIOS and chipset drivers.)  DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more. http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html  For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.  Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.  Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)  Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.  Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.  Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.  Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites. http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm How to Install a Device Driver in Vista Device Manager http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html  If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be older and cause issues.

By your question i gather you are either talking about OneNote or Sticky Notes on your system, when it suddenly shutdown: Now let me give a solution to both and hopefully this should assist you: Microsoft One Note: (Please refer to the following resources) https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Recover-deleted-notes-32ed1036-74fd-4c21-bc28-033a486e6b14 or https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/Find-my-lost-notes-32cb2bd7-afe7-44d2-a711-398a88421287 or https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_onenote-mso_other/how-to-recover-a-missing-notebook-from-onenote/b36d0eea-2f97-4f14-9924-1e02b3368389?auth=1 Microsoft Sticky Notes: Microsoft sticky notes are in most cases automatically saved and should appear after a reboot, in a case when the notes does not popup simply: click on your start button and type sticky then hit enter and they should all appear again.

Reason: NotePad does not automatically save notes like Word, this requires you to save the text manually, In this case it comes with much regret but if these resources does not work then you have lost your notes.

"I bought a new Asus computer Sept. 2017. Text in the tool bars of a few programs were very small and almost impossible to read. One program was a VOIP Connect (program to make cheap phone calls) Other apps similar problems After 3 days of reading everything I could about the problem online and changing all the settings for fonts in various programs, no solution was found.  So I finally called Microsoft tech support  I had an older computer with the same apps/programs also running Windows 10 but an older version, and these apps/programs still worked fine with fonts big enough to read. so I had suggested the problem was a MS  Windows 10 problem. The tech as usual with MS did not want to believe this, and kept telling me the problems were with the apps.  That was until I let him access both computers and see both screens at the same time.  Old computer with big fonts in tool bars that could be read, and same apps open in new computer, with fonts in tool bars too small to read.  I spent 2 days with them for a total of at least 6 to 8 hours. They (from India) tried everything I had done several times, including uninstall and reinstall the apps/program, still no fix to very small fonts  The the MS tech finally reinstalled Windows 10 Ver 1703, that came with the new computer a few days earlier Below is what the MS tech wrote to fix the problem  if that kind of error occured fonts too small on some apps tool bars so please download the iso file of the windows version which the user is using  and then do repair your windows  open a browser and type media creation tool and click on download tool now then click on run  and then wait for that file to be downloaded then open that windows file and then click on setup and it will start installing the windows again and it will take time as according to the system speed minimum should be 40-50 min","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"Have finally solved the problem!  After trying to re-install Edge several times following instructions found on the web made no difference, I then came across a mention that Trusteer Endpoint Protection was causing the issue. I stopped Trusteer by:  Save your work and close all open windows. From the Windows Start menu, select Programs > Trusteer Endpoint Protection > Stop Trusteer Endpoint Protection. A security confirmation message appears. The message displays an image of some characters for you to type.  Enter the characters that you see in the image. Click Shutdown.

Hi  This is PRAVEEN I have an OS  Windows 7 Professtional ........ I  think my computer is hacked from outside source   So  Can u tell me ....How to find out if my computer is hacked or not.... and if it is hacked how to recover from the hacking ....,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
Why do you think you are hacked? Have you seen any odd things happen? Windows is like a very large ant hive there are millions of things goin on alle the time. Most normal people can't undestand the complexity of it all and that alone can get your mind spinning. For me it was Windows System log that started to give me errors that i couldent find an anwser for. The best way to deal with a hacker is very simple...unpluck the PC from internet...second best thing is keeping all programs updated. Run Antivirus software. Use Microsoft sites to learn how to tighten the security on your system. https://www.heimdalagent.com/da/home This little tool is great..keeps your system updated. http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/aa905062 Firewall Policy Wireshark ..or Network Monitor from microsoft. Monitor network trafic (warning this can give you grey hair) hehe Attack Surface Analyzer (Beta) Microsoft Security Assessment Tool Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer and so on...lots and lots of tools and documents to read.... So unless you are 100% sure your hacked you should just relax a bit have some beer and enjoy life away from PC a Bit....most the time if you get hacked..you wont even know it before they are gone and now are spending your money and drinking your beer :) Hope this helps alittle...if not someone else might have better anwsers.  ,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

While other websites could be reached and there was nothing wrong with my network, I simply could not activate the Feedback Hub.  The answer to my question is very simple.

"Hi Jenna56,  I should be able to shed some light on this, after having enjoyed this app for the past few months.  I've got a slightly different issue today, though should be able to help your query as not sure you've had the best responses so far.  I've been using the Photo's App on my Surface Pro 4 successfully for the past few months.  It works great - I just take photos on my mobile phone, they upload into One Drive, and then hey presto I return everytime to the Albums section in the Photo's App and I've got a nice neat album of quality photo's from the day.  Indeed, not all the photos are present - I noticed this and seems normal functionality.  I found this odd at first, though now I get how this works:  ""Collections"" stores all your photos - which is effectively your 'folders' ""Albums"" is Microsoft's way of digesting the photos in your folder/collection, to a user-friendly, readily viewable album folder.  The Photos App seems to cleverly apply some logic to: remove duplicate photo's, select the best photo's, identify a choice few photos from similar images, remove blurred images, remove poorly lit images.  What's is left seems to be the App's best attempt to start a great album for you, to summarise the photo's from the day.  In addition to this, it chooses a good album cover photo, and also applies the ""Enhance"" to enhance all the images in the Album.   The result (and ultimate benefit), is that by doing nothing, you can just open up your album and immediately have available a good album set to view yourself or show to others.  If you want *all* photo's just go to Collections - which is unfiltered.  So Albums starts off an album for you based on the photo's taken for that day.  I then 'optimise' the album by choosing ""Edit"" in the top right corner, then click + 'Add or Remove photos'.  The logic applied is excellent, although it doesn't always get all the photos you want, so I manually select/de-select photos as appropriate.  I have found this really useful, as when taking photo's I do have many duplicates and blurred ones - I also have 100's of photo directories, and going through each one is a) very time consuming and b) I don't like to delete photo's, so the Album is a useful ""view"" on photo's you want. I find it great for showing kids/parents.  In summary, it's normal functionality - just use Collections if you prefer all photos.  I'm no expert in this btw, this is just how I've been using it.  For info, I have a separate problem in that since the Aug 2016 Microsoft Windows 10 update, I have now lost all my albums ...","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]"

I'm using maps preview on Windows 8.1 but I can't find an option to show the scale. Maps without a scale are not much use! Thanks John,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"Hi,  Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community Forums. You have reached the right place. Let us work together to find the root cause of this issue and try resolving it.  One of the more difficult questions to answer about a Bing map involves determining the exact scale or resolution of a particular image. The answer is complicated as resolution depends on several factors including the current latitude and longitude. Scale is further dependent on screen resolution. In this article we will look at the factors that affect scale and resolution and provide you with formulas you can use to calculate approximate values.  I would suggest you to see the following link for more information:  Understanding Scale and Resolution http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa940990.aspx  Post us the results after you try the above steps.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Jennifer, is this a joke?","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"I checked out the post. It said a lot of complex stuff about calculations to find the EXACT scale.  I am not trying to find the exact scale, just a general idea.  For example, if two points on my screen are 1/3 of my screen apart, are they a foot apart, a mile apart, or a thousand miles apart?  There is no way to tell unless you already know a distance and can measure it and compare it.    The post says that if you don't need exact, you can just use the scale shown on the map screen.  But there is no scale on the map screen.  that is want I am trying to get to show.  Somehow, it must have come in a turned off condition on my computer.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

"I am just distraught over the fact that Bing Maps has changed. They were so much better than Google Maps, especially after Google changed their maps to the 'enhanced' view. None of the images were or are clear. Well now Bing Maps has taken the same road. Instead of leaving a good thing alone, they had to go and change the imagery to the 'enhanced' look and now everything is all distorted. I love looking at different types and styles of homes and now everyone I want to look closer at gets distorted. This was my way of traveling the world as I am housebound.  WHY DID THEY HAVE TO DO THIS? If they wanted to change the Maps, at least give us a link to the old mapping system so we can enjoy the REAL IMAGES instead of the computer generated maps. PLEASE, please Bing, let us use the older mapping system again with a link to the older maps. The new one is going to make Bing followers flee and drop Bing altogether. Does anyone out their know of a mapping system with Birds Eye view that shows the 'raw' images like Bing Maps used to until today? They obviously don't care about their long term clients (I have been here since the beginning of Bing and the internet) I am looking to log out of Microsoft and Bing forever.... Here are a few examples, though these are the GOOD ones.. Please click on them to really SEE the difference.  PLEASE BRING OUR OLD MAPS BACK! (Or a link to the older version) Thank you.

"The problem isn't that the application installation is corrupted it is that there is a bug in the program. It affects all the systems that I have (1 PC, 1 Phone and 1 Tablet) and the problem also is if I use it without the application at all but login to a webpage to use the diet tracker - i.e. MSN Health & Fitness.  It's a programming bug. You can use the 'Recent' list and the 'Custom' list no problem. However the 'Favorites' list screws up the entries - even on the website with no app installed. Also there are favourites that are left over from when it used the 'Health Vault' that cannot be deleted or used so that causes problems as well.  For example: If I login to the MSN Health and Fitness and then select, 'Chicken Fillet Classic - Subway' from my favourites menu, then nothing happens - I cannot use the item and I cannot delete it either.  Another example: If I use the Windows 8.1 App it does let me select the 'Chicken Fillet Classic - Subway' however when it populates the data in to the 'Lunch' field the carbs, protein and fat data is all zero and the Calories information is wrong. Once this happens reselecting the item from 'recent' then reproduces the error. So for the moment the 'Favourites' menu is bugged.

Then how did it get set to Chinese from the English language without my permission?!?  No one complaining about this has ever gotten a useful response from Microsoft. You know changing the language setting and enabling cookies will not fix it. You all know what is actually going on, but you refuse to tell us what is really going on. Why?

"I installed Bing Desktop on my tablet so I could get the daily wallpaper. I installed it, and was really happy to see that my wallpaper became the Bing daily image. I heard Bing Desktop was part of Microsoft Update, so I checked Windows Update later on to see if there were any available updates. And that's when the problems started happening. Windows Update would either give me the error code 0x800705b4 or it would take really (and I do mean REALLY) long to check for updates and install them or say it's up to date. There was a fix that was said to be permanent, but was only a fix for one day for me. It was to turn off Microsoft Update in Advanced Options, restart, check for updates, re-enable Microsoft Update, check for updates, and then everything would work as it should. When I discovered this fix, I was really happy to know that everything would be okay. So I did what the instructions told me to do, and everything seemed fine. So the next day, I wanted to see what Bing's daily image was going to be. I logged on to my tablet, but the same image from yesterday was there, and it didn't update. I checked Bing's website, and the daily image was changed on the website. I went to Windows Update again to see if Bing Desktop needed an update to fix this problem, and I was greeted by the same Windows Update problems from yesterday. This meant that I had to do the fix EVERY DAY. Yeah, I don't want to restart my tablet every day just to fix a bug. And I realized the only way for Bing Desktop to update its image is if I restarted the tablet. Is there any way to fix these problems?

"Hi,  Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.  Yes, Bing allows direct linking and you link directly to the sales page from the Bing ad. Here are the steps to start a direct linking campaign on Bing:  1: Setup your first campaign  First, open a Bing or Microsoft account. Then you can create your first campaign. Click on the “Campaigns” tab and select “Create campaign”. Then, name your campaign and set up the budget.  2: Create your ad  Next, you need to actually write your ad. Make sure you research your product well and pick the most appropriate keywords for your target market. When you’re done, enter the ad title, ad text, the Display URL and the Destination URL.  Here’s the difference between Display URL and Destination URL?   The Display URL is where you can add your main keyword to increase the click-through-rate and improve your results. Remember, although the Display and Destination URL are used for different purpose, the domain name of the Display URL and Destination URL should always be the same. If you’re using more than one word in the Display URL, you can separate those either by an underscore or by hyphens.  3: Add your affiliate link  Now it’s time to add your affiliate link in the Destination URL box. However, you should never run affiliate campaigns without using some sort of tracking that can be used to track your results.   Hope this information is helpful.

Example:  Earn 1 credit per every 2 Bing searches up to 15 credits.  You'll also see the same information for Mobile Search.

"Hi, I am trying to help my parents use a new PC and showing them Bing.   What we'd like to do is have them have Bing as their homepage - easy.    Then say they want to go to ""amazon.com"", they enter amazon.com in the search box - also easy. The question / problem is, they get many results and this confuses them.  Is there a way to have Bing just go straight to the website?   I thought I saw somewhere you could use double quotes and it's just go to that site, but that didn't seem to work.   Anyone know if this is possible?   Thanks in advance, Chris","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

"Hi, I'm having several problems. I cannot open the game bar it says ""Can't save your recording. Make sure that your captures folder allows files to be saved."" I'm also unable to open the folder my captures are saved to from the Game DVR panel in settings. Also, when I go to Game bar in Settings and try to move the slider across to Record game clips, screenshots and broadcast using Game bar it will let me do it but then when I switch screens and go back it is unsaved and I can't get it to permanently stay On. All I have done is copied then deleted my current videos, pictures and documents and game screenshots across from the PC to a USB drive for record keeping and then I deleted the folders (except game screenshot folders like steam and world of screenshots) so I could start clean with them because videos I have take up alot of storage. It shouldn't have been a issue though I thought because the folders I deleted we're inside the primary PC user folders like Documents, Downloads, Pictures and Videos.

"Hi Kristopher,   Issues with saving your video clips or using the Game bar on Windows 10 are possibly caused by an outdated Xbox app or a corrupted folder on Windows Explorer. To resolve your concern, we suggest that you move your saved video clips to another folder within the PC. The next saved videos will automatically go to the new folder.  If the issue persists, reset Windows Store to clear the store cache. Then, uninstall and reinstall the Xbox App to manually update it by following the steps below:  To reset Windows Store:  To update the Xbox App:  You can also sign in to another use to isolate if there is an issue with your profile.

"Solution:  Move the original Captures folder back to it's original location. Make sure you don't just copy and paste it, you need to cut and paste the folder so it properly goes back to it's former location which can take some time to do. Once that is complete, if you want to move your pictures and/or videos across to USB or another location Open your Captures folder and select all your files then cut and paste them into a New folder on your USB or other location... The Game bar will still work because it can find the Captures folder in it's original location and all the settings will be restored. Hope this resolves your question.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

The problems is, NEITHER of these are the ONE number I have attached to my account! I tried to sign into my e-mail (via Bing) and it did the same thing. How the heck can I change this when it won't even give me the option to change it or sign in any other way?! I even have my Outlook account attached to my I-phone (via Email) and it still seems to want to text the security code to numbers I don't have! I have already checked my e-mail security settings, and everything is as it should be. I have no idea what to do, but am extremely frustrated. I now remember why I should NEVER update aps ugg.","[1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]"

"On September 2nd I purchased an annual subscription (known as Premium membership) in order to play without watching adverts. About 6 weeks ago I lost the premium membership - being told that the subscription had ended and inviting me to renew. After putting a message on the in game message board the premium membership was restored after about 4 hours. I lost it again last Thursday night (December 17th). Another message posted without success. More than 1.5 hours spent on the telephone to Customer Services (MS) on Friday had me tearing my hair out. Eventually it took so long for them to put me through to technical support that Customer Services decided they were too busy to answer. I was told to contact them myself. Spoke to Xbox Customer Services, more helpful, and was advised again that I should deal with technical support. Found out that technical support do not work on a weekend. I then decided, today (Sunday) to speak to MS Accounts through whom I paid the subscription. Was advised that although purchased from them a refund was not allowed for Apps purchases unless the App had failed. Still not got the Premium service restored with little time tomorrow in order to contact technical support. Has anyone else had this problem and if so how did you get it restored promptly? All sorted Monday afternoon by Xbox tech support by giving a refund (unofficially?) which enabled me to re-subscribe. They eventually stated that there had been a breach on my subscription (didn't ask what that meant). They also said that the matter should have been sorted by MS sales. Thank you Xbox for getting me out of this nightmare!  Have now purchased a 30 day subscription to ensure all now working OK so that I will be more comfortable purchasing another annual option. Sorry MS but a great big failure with no-one willing to take the pressure off me.......poor, poor show :-( :-(","[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]"

"William Soni,  Thank you for the prompt response.  You asked if I was using the Bing app or web browser.  What's the difference?  When I was notified of a newer version of Bing without even thinking about it I deleted the old bing and got the newest version.

There is a box that allows an email link, bookmark link, translate link, copy link, transfer to Facebook, Twitter.  Then there's the four square box that gives you trend, weather, news etc. Then there's a silhouette of a human that gives me my Microsoft account and Bing rewards.  There is no button available for an option to print.

Logically I add it to a group which states it is about ""Unexpected search results"" due to searching my problem and feeling this subject is pretty much akin to my issue - I send a query to Bing maps which can be considered a search (I could go deeper to my reasoning, but it seems you have a job to close questions or move them around to another group).  But, I understand the possibility you are correct, yet, when I read other user questions, I see replies telling people to move on to another group, so I am starting to believe somebody is paid to simply shift questions rather than help with a workable answer because it is beyond their academic capacity.

"Hi,   Thank you so much for posting your query on this forum.   From the issue description, I understand that you have set your browser homepage as “Bing.com”, however, when you sign out from your Outlook.com email account, it redirects automatically to the MSN website and would like to know if you can change any settings so that it goes to the Bing website.   The Outlook.com website is designed in such a way that it redirects automatically to the MSN website whenever the user logs out from the Outlook.com email account. This behavior cannot be changed by changing any settings on the computer. This is by the website design. For example, if you have a YahooMail account and when you logs out your account, it takes you to the website “us.yahoo.com”. It does not connect to your homepage or any other websites. This is how the yahoo website is designed.   However, if you want to access the Bing website, you just need to close the current session of the browser and then open a new browser session on the computer and that would connect you to the Bing website automatically.

"I am working on creating MapPoint maps by linking them to Excel tables. These tables contain a lot of data which makes the maps I created cluttered and not easy to visualize information on. To solve the issue, I'm thinking about using a slicer to make the Excel tables display only part of the rows at a time and have the maps only display the data selected with the help of the slicer. I believe that it could be possible to do that by adding a COM add-in to MapPoint and writing code to tell MapPoint to only display on the map the data filtered in the Excel table using the slicer. Has anyone tried that, and if yes how can this be done? I don't really have programming skills so if that is possible, the next thing would be to help me write a code to get MapPoint to do that....Please let me know if that's completely far-fetched as it's just a crazy idea that I had to try to solve my problem.

Consider setting up a different user account on the computer if you commonly allow others to use it. A completely separate user account takes only seconds to switch over to and your own desktop and work can remain static in the background.  Modern social media takes the unwarranted position that everyone wants them to have every personal detail of their lives and they attempt to conjoin onto every process they can. Set up a new user account and let others deal with the parasitic 'couplings' or simply tell them to get their own computer.,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"Hi Jennifer,   Welcome to Bing community!   I understand that you want your business to show up on the Bing listings.   If your listing is verified, it will typically take up to 14 days for business information to update on Bing. Listing search results and rankings can change due to a number of factors that are not directly in the control of the user. However, you may improve your results by keeping your listing up to date by adding specific and relevant categories, a detailed and relevant description of your business, photos, and professional contacts. Our recommendation is to apply as much business listing information as possible to improve your overall listing relevancy, which may potentially impact your listing rank.   If you want to talk with a Bing Places for Business support, please visit this link then click the support link at the bottom of the page. If you want to report data issues in Bing Maps please visit this link.   Hope this address your concern.   Thank you for using Bing!","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"Getting verified doesn't help. As far as I can tell Microsoft doesn't take whether a business is registered in Bing local into account when giving search results. My business has been open since March. I registered with Bing local in August and confirmed I'm listed under the category motorcycle shops. There are fewer than ten such shops in Toronto, but I'm not showing up in the top thirty. Seriously. There are florists, insurance companies, long closed businesses and out of town businesses showing ahead of me on Bing Local. When I search specifically for Toronto Motorcycle Shops, about eight listings show up when I select show all businesses. Mine isn't on it, but a few ebike dealers are, a long defunct Harley dealer and a burger joint. I can only conclude that registering with Bing is a waste of time. I'm paying for Bing ads and that dies slightly better. Whatever algorithmic Bing uses for search, being registered or currently in business are not factors. I fell sorry for doctors who show up under the undertaker listings. ","[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1]"

"Here's one curious thing that I discovered. I've been trying all the things listed to get my store to show up. The obvious search terms are ""Toronto Motorcycle Shop"" No luck. There's a hamburger joint with motorcycle in its name, some insurance brokers that offer motorcycle insurance, several out of town shops and some that are closed, but I'm nowhere. I change the search to just ""motorcycle shop"" which lets Bing decide the location and I show up right at the top. Now I happen to be in Toronto, so I don't know why using that word would cause my listing to be excluded. My address is consistently shown as being in Toronto.  You might be interested that Google has its own peculiarity. Including Toronto or not makes no difference, but I don't show up for searches for ""motorcycle shops"" at all. I show up fairly high if I search for ""motorcycle stores"" and when I show up my Google listing describes my store as a ""motorcycle shop"".   Of course the trouble is that I think most people will search for ""Toronto motorcycle shop"" and not some odd variant.

"The Historical weather information for Payson Arizona is reported incorrectly in the MS Weather Application. MS reports that the historical data is provided by Weather Trends International. I have contacted them and they have advised that they have not provided Payson historical weather data to MS and also determined that the data appears to be the same as Scottsdale Arizona. It seems that there must be programming that looks for a close geographic city and provides that data as an accurate representation of the area. Payson is a mountain community located 5,000 feet above Scottsdale. Our climate is significantly different from Scottsdale with actual historical variance 10 to 20 degrees different on average from those shown in the MS Weather App. I assume that if the MS Weather App programming looks for close geographic cities, when the program does not have actual information from Weather Trends International, it is being repeated for many small cities across the country and perhaps the world. Why is this a big deal? Many folks looking for places to vacation or retire will look at the MS Weather app for Payson Arizona and assume that the current and historical data is accurate. When they see historical averages of highs and lows that are 10-20 degrees higher than the real actuals, they will assume Payson weather is like Phoenix and drop it from consideration. To others who live in smaller communities across the country, please check the historical temperature and rainfall data for accuracy. Perhaps this is only an issue for Payson.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1]"

"Thanks for the reply Stephanie, This problem has existed for quite a while both in Win 8.1, where I clicked the ""Send Feedback"" button within the app to explain the problem and also in Win10 where I clicked on the Smiley Face to provide Windows Feedback of this problem in the Weather App. In the feedback I explained the problem in some detail and was advised, when I submitted the Feedback, that I would not get a response and Thank You. I assumed that someone at Microsoft (MS) monitors the feedback and investigates the problems.  In both cases I waited to see a fix and after months, never saw the fix. I have looked at other cities and it appears that historical data is correct, just not for Payson. When I saw online that Microsoft identified the vendors who provide the data for the weather app, I contacted the source for historical information and they responded in an email to my problem. Payson is not one of the cities that they provide data for and their research indicated that the Payson historical info was the same as Scottsdale. They suggested that this is a Microsoft App problem and that I should contact Microsoft. Knowing that no results were achieved when reporting through ""Send Feedback"" within the App I thought it might be appropriate to send a request to the Microsoft Community and hope some one would read my problem. Glad I was heard and you replied to the problem. I have validated the error on 3 PCs, two of which are running Win 10 and one on Win 8.1. All give the same incorrect results. I attempted to run the ""troubleshoot problems"" script, but it failed because it does not yet work on Win 10. Regardless I don't think the problem is on my computers but in the way the Application is programmed to provide historical data when a city does not have information from a source. Let me know if there is anything else I can do or information I can provide to better explain the problem. Thanks, PaulSamantha","[0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0]"

" Thanks, Carolyn Here's what I did: 1. Sign up for Microsoft Health Vault. 2. Go to the HealthVault tab/page of the Bing Health & Fitness App Settings, and connect to HealthVault there. 3. All data from the old phone will be stored on the cloud. 4. Refresh the HealthVault web site on your desktop or restart your phone to see all your exercises sync'd in the GPS tracker and online.   Additional info if helpful: The Bing Health & Fitness App data is not saved locally on the phone, so most of the suggestions in SmittyChat's response above didn't work (sorry).  Here's where the confusion stems: when you open the Health & Fitness App, if you go to the bottom-right and expand the menu options, the app gives you the option to connect to ""Microsoft Account."" It's not clear to me where the data goes when you do that, but I never found it again. But, if from that same expanded menu you select ""Settings,"" instead of ""Microsoft Account,"" there's a HealthVault tab/page that lets you connect to HealthVault so that when you sign in to Health Vault (on the phone or desktop) you can access your exercise history under Measurements > History.

"Hi,   There are several reasons why you are unable to launch the Game bar on Windows 10.

"  As mentioned in the OP I'm on a desktop PC (Win OS on SSD, i7 4790, R9 390, 32 GB DDR3). This is a very capable gaming rig, and easily exceeds the sys requirements. No. I never tried previously to launch the Game Bar. This is the first time I've tried and I haven't been able to get it to launch.   Changes to Windows 10? None other than the usual updates  I just tried this now. I was able to uninstall and reinstall the Xbox app. When I went to try and launch the Game Bar it flashed on the screen for about a second and then was gone. Only way to get it back was to again uninstall and reinstall the Xbox App. I was able to then launch the Game Bar and this time it stayed open. But if I then go to launch the game it disappears. I've discovered that if I toggle the slider from Off to On in Settings > Gaming >Game Bar i can get it back but it's acting really weird.  Accessing the Game bar menu locks up the screen and I have to restart Explorer to get everything back.   So I've got it to show but I'm still completely unsuccessful actually getting it to now work with a game. If I have to toggle the slider in  Settings > Gaming >Game Bar to get it to work, then the game minimizes. Then when I click to relaunch the game neither Win + G or Ctrl + Shift + G works to launch game Bar because the Settings menu is then not the active window. So I'm stuck in that fail loop. Clicking the game maximizes the game, but no Game bar .... Clicking Settings to toggle the slider allows me to show the Game Bar but the game isn't maximized to allow the Game Bar to recognize it .... I click the Game bar menu settings and it then locks up the screen .... so there's no way to activate both at the same time - I either have an active Game Bar and no game, or an active Game and no Game Bar.   So it actually shows up now but is definitely not working properly      ","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]"
"Thank you for your response. For PC games in full-screen mode, you won’t see the Game bar, but you can use the Windows logo key + Alt + R to start and stop recordings. You’ll see the screen flash when the recording starts and completes. You can also use the Windows logo key + Alt + G to record the last 30 seconds if you’ve already turned on background recording.   If the shortcuts do not work for a full-screen game, press Win + G. You’ll see the screen flash twice confirming that the game is recognized. After this, you can then run the game in full-screen again and use the Windows logo key + Alt + R and Windows logo key + Alt + G. If the issue persists, we suggest that you check for new Windows Updates and install the critical and important updates on your computer by following the steps on this link. If your customized shortcuts are not working, you may also check for updates for apps and games from Windows Store by following the steps on this link.

"Thanks Michael,  Part of my problem with this was just not understanding how it's supposed to show up when it's working. Now that I understand that better, I can see that it works, but only if I use the method I mentioned to reset it for each instance of use - that is to toggle the slider from On to Off to On again in Win 10 PC Settings > Gaming >Game Bar That seems to be the only way I can get it to work. Whether that's intended function or not ... it works and I can live with that for now. I'd go to a third party app b4 spending any more time on this.   The other part is that when accessing the Game bar menu I can make changes, but for some reason it still locks up the screen and I have to restart Explorer to get everything on my desktop back. But when I reopen Game Bar the changes have been saved so it is technically working, but with the Explorer restart glitch. So 50% success with this but I don't want to waste any more time on this. I will revisit this after WIndows 10's next major update where I'll choose to reinstall the OS, rather than slipstream the updates. ","[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]"

"Thank you for the reply, However, I would like to know if you actually understood my question? I can create a personal map with pushpins etc, but I cannot save a created map that has been Bing.it to me via e-mail from someone else.  Example: My friend created a map with sites to visit. Bing'd.it to me and Shared. I receive the link, open it, and there it is. However, I want to save this as my map too, and add to it. NOT possible per your site (Unless of course there is a very small button or drop down buried deep and not logical to find on the SHARED map). If this is not possible (i.e., saving a shared map), then just say ""This unfortunately is not possible"". I would then answer with thank you, maybe this should be forwarded to suggestions for future fixes.  Try this yourself: Please create a map with multiple sites; save it for your self, then SHARE it to another e-mail address or your Windows 8.1 Phone (colleague in your office or wherever). You will notice that you CAN NOT save this map as your own (if it is NOT your own Live.com or Bing Account).  Notice, I said a different account, because of course if you log into your own account, it will be there.

"Hello Christopher,   If you are referring to the profile picture that displays when you are in Bing, julientremblay17Bruce is right. It synchronizes depending on how you connect with Bing and there are two possible ways on how you can do this. Here are the steps that you can perform to get your profile picture in Facebook or Microsoft account displayed in Bing:  1) Go to http://www.bing.com  2) Click on the Sign in down arrow icon then select on how you wish to connect to Bing.    a. Connect to Facebook    b. Connect to Microsoft account  3) If you select connecting to Facebook, just enter the email address and password that you are using to sign in to your Facebook account.  Likewise, sign in with the email address and password you are using to access your Hotmail/Outlook.com inbox when connecting to Microsoft account.  Both of which will redirect to the Bing homepage after. However, the profile picture set up on your Facebook/Microsoft account will not synchronize with Bing right away.  4) To see your Facebook/Microsoft account profile picture in Bing, just search for anything in Bing search box. Your picture will then appear at the top right end of the search results page.  Hope this helps!  Beth  ","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]"

"What the other gents have said is true, however, since there is some likelihood of problems when installing or activating FSX (fixes that 'mostly' work are available), most are switching over to FSX-Steam Edition.  This is from Dovetail Games and under limited licence, they have improved the old FSX substantially.   Apart from it now becoming a 64 bit piece of software (giving a better VAS, plus others), it can only be downloaded (which means that you always have a copy on your external media) and also needs no activation.   As well, FSX-Steam is basically FSX with the Acceleration module included and for the best part, it sells for around USD25 (basic version).   You can also buy the basic version with various other inclusions for a higher cost.  http://store.steampowered.com/app/314160/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator_X_Steam_Edition/","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]"

"Hello Jonathan,  Welcome to Bing Community!  The results that you receive when you search the Internet with the Bing search box depend on how you construct your search query. Since you would like to search for file types, you should identify first which specific file type you are looking for. For images, you can use .gif, .jpg, .jpeg or .png file extensions as search query. If you are in search for documents, the extensions are .doc, .pdf or .xls.  For example, you would like to search for images of dogs in jpeg format. Type these as search queries either in the Web or Images tab: +dogs .jpeg Search result URL: http://www.bing.com/images/search?q=%2bdogs+.jpeg&FORM=RCIR  You will notice that the search results will show images of dogs in .jpeg format only. However, if you would like to include some results in .jpg format, just type in, dogs .jpeg as search queries.

"Hi,   Welcome to Microsoft Community.   I understand that you wanted to disable IP based search results from Bing. Basically this is a backend based configuration just like other websites and search engines. However you may override it from your end by properly selecting your appropriate market.   Selecting markets would give you different results based on local cultural norms and sensibilities, restrictions and laws of that particular country. For example, indexed results when US market is selected would be different from the results other countries or markets are selected like China or the Middle East. If the browser does not accept your Market selection, then you may need to allow cookies to remember your configuration.   Allowing Cookies in IE: 1. Open Internet Explorer. 2. Click Tools from the menu bar. 3. Choose Internet Options from the dropdown menu. 4. Click the Privacy tab. 5. Hit the Advanced button. 6. Make sure that the following options are checked:      a. Override automatic cookie handling.      b. Accept under First-party cookies.      c. Accept under Third-party cookies.      d. Always allow session cookies. 7. Click OK to close the Advanced Privacy Settings window. Select the Apply then OK buttons to close the Internet Options window.   I hope I have clear things out.

"3/4/2015 Andrea, I installed the latest Win8 x64 driver for my printer. That helped, but not completely. I suspected that the problem was with the website and I was right. In IE11 the F12 tools have evolved quite nicely. The various help pages insist that the developer test early and often. That apparently not done when the print css was developed. I was surprised to find that IE7 was the default emulation. Even changing the emulation to IE8 eliminated the issue with the pagination. I looked at the source and found this in the <head> <meta http-equiv=""X-UA-Compatible"" content=""IE=7"" />  That restricts Internet Explorer to the document modes of IE7. Now, to put it into perspective, in 2010 MS issued a warning that support for IE6 and 7 was ending. Most larger sites phased out support for IE7 several years ago. Since the meta tag above is only followed by IE, it makes sense why Firefox printed correctly.  I did some elementary troubleshooting that the site developers should have done. Hopefully, by pointing to a line of code, it can be ""fixed"" quickly.","[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]"

"Hello, I am currently experiecing the following issues with the Bing Health & Fitness App for windows phone 8 - For the Diet Tracker - UK based food auto entries seem to have been removed. When adding a food item in the serach foods box I used to get auto complete suggestions that including UK centric food. These seem to have been missing sometime between Fri 19 Sept to Sun 21 Sept. Initiating the diet tracker, adding items and loading up previous days food seems to take a very long time. I have timed adding one food item can take up to 3 minutes (even when connected to Wifi). Adding items into the connect Health Vault account via the internet (not from a mobile device) do not appear back on the Health and Vault WP8 app. For the Excercise Tracker - After entering an excercise the data does not seem to have been logged when th app navigates back to the excercise summary. However, on exiting to the home page and then navigating back to the escercise traker the entries can been seen. As well as these points (the missing UK food entries being the most fustrating) I have previoulsy sent feedback in regards to possible improvements via the WP8 app. These are: Function to group food into a meal. For example being able to group all the individual items for a particular meal that I eat on a regular basis would help tremendously. Enable flow of entries udpated in health vault to the Bing Healt and Fitness WP8 app would be very useful. Speed up the application - when selcting the wrong food entries and hitting the back button, rather than clearing the last serach and having to type again leave the last search in place reduce the amount of data that has to be loaded on each page, why can't some of the data be held temp  locally on the WP8 device.

"Hi Eric,  Welcome to Microsoft community forum. Sorry for the inconvenience caused.  I would appreciate if you could answer the following questions:     You may face this issue due to changes in web browser settings or if Silverlight is not installed on the computer. To fix this problem, use the following methods in the order in which they are listed. After each method, check if problem is fixed. If the problem is not fixed, try the next method.   Method 1: Bing maps uses Silverlight plugin in order to work more accurately. I would suggest you to install the Microsoft Silverlight and check if it helps:  http://www.microsoft.com/getsilverlight/Get-Started/Install/Default.aspx    If issue persist, proceed to next method.

"You do sync to Healthvault You could share info through Healthvault consider carefully which people should be allowed to see the information. What options do I have for sharing health information?   There are several ways in HealthVault to share health  information:   Give another HealthVault user online access to part or all of a HealthVault record: You can give people who have HealthVault accounts access to some or all of the  information in a HealthVault record. You can specify either read-only access or permission to modify the record. You can also specify which types of health  information to  share and not  share. Learn how to share a record. Create an emergency profile: An emergency profile contains key medical  information that others can view in an emergency. You can print wallet cards or page-sized sheets containing your emergency profile information. You can also create access codes that give online access to your emergency profile, which might be more up-to-date than a printout. Learn more about creating an emergency profile. Print information from your record and show the printout to your doctor or other person. Learn more about printing health information. Use encrypted messaging: To protect the privacy of medical-related email with your doctors, use the Message Center app (US accounts only). This app uses encryption to reduce the chance of unauthorized access to sensitive health  information that you exchange with your doctors.  Learn more about Message Center. How do I give access to a HealthVault record to another trusted person?   To share your health record with someone you trust:   Sign in to HealthVault. On the left side of the page, click Sharing. Click Share health information with someone you trust. Complete the form, then click Send invitation.  A few things to note:   You choose the level of access you allow. You can let someone view and use but not change  information, view and change  information, or act as a custodian of the record. People you share with can authorize apps to have the same kind of access they do. For example, someone who can only view  information can allow an app to view the  information, but not to change it. You also decide what types of information you want to  share. You can select specific  information types, or you can  share everything in your record. If you give access only to selected items, you’ll need to send a new sharing invitation if you later decide to  share additional  information types. To provide an extra level of security for the invitation, set a passcode. Don't forget to tell the recipient the passcode! You can set a new one if you resend the invitation. You can set an expiration date on the recipient's access. In addition, HealthVault sets an expiration date on the invitation; if the invitation is not accepted within the expiration period, you will need to resend it. To accept the invitation, the person you invite to access the record must have a HealthVault account. If they do not have one, they will be invited to sign up for HealthVault.  Note   For performance reasons, Windows Phone allows only one location tracking app to remain active at any given time. If you need to use an app that requires access to your location while the Bing Health & Fitness app is tracking your workout (even a non-fitness app, such as Facebook or Bing search), we recommend that you launch the Bing Health & Fitness app again after you're done so the app remains active and continues to track your workout.   https://account.healthvault.com/help/en-US/default.htm    Hope this helps.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]"

"Hi,  Welcome to Microsoft Community Forum.  Based on the issue description I can understand that Bing maps are not working in Mozilla Firefox and its working on Chrome and Internet Explorer. To answer your question Bing maps will be compatible with Internet Explorer than any other browser.

This proved to be caused by the configuration of the Privacy Badger (tracking cookies) extension - Bing Maps requires access to a third party website.  The extension is installed in Firefox on both PCs.  Bing Maps used to work on both PCs but recently only on one.  Presumably the setting that disabled Privacy Badger protection for *.live.com had become lost or corrupted on the problem PC.  (Quite how is another matter.)  Once the *.live.com exception had been re-added all was well again.  P.S. I asked on this forum rather the Mozilla one because I wished to find out what Bing Maps required in order to work correctly.  Now I have found that access to bing.com is not sufficient - access to live.com is required also.  This was not immediately apparent on using Bing Maps.  JPL,"[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

"I'm scrambling to get out of Google Maps new kerfuffles. My main issue is I have a bunch of maps I've developed over the years. They include personal interests, like all the buildings by a specific architect, to work stuff like stock photo locations I would like to add to my stock photo library. It used to be really easy with Google Maps. You'd just do a google search for, say as a dumb example, Golden Gate Bridge- and along side the results a map would pop up. I could then select the map and click save to my maps and a list of all my maps would appear. I'd add the location to my Bridges of the San Francisco Bay Area map. I would occasionally export those files as KML and load on my phone where I could pull them up, even when I was offline. My places in the new Google Maps has pretty much disappeared. Now I need an alternative. I just tried adding one of my most important maps to Bing Maps. After the import a message came up that the new map was limited to 200 POIs. Is there any way around that?

"Hi Kelly,   It seems like you have some performance issues with Bing Sports apps. I understand how annoying this could be. Please answer these questions so I can understand the issue better.

Step 1: Run the Apps troubleshooter. This tool can automatically identify and fix some problems with apps.  Note: The troubleshooter automatically fixes some issues that might prevent your apps from running, including suboptimal screen resolution and incorrect security or account settings.

The game i am enchancing is plain cartoonish... http://www.matrixgames.com/products/351/details/War.in.the.Pacific.-.Admiral%27s.Edition So i am trying to find out do i need permissons to use these maps into my project, another word by adding Bing Map logo on it? After messing with those maps for three days and coming out really great and realistic and i had to do alot of adjustments to it, since the game is off by 25 degrees to the East. Guess the game maps isnt that accurate, but least i can make it look much better. There already several fans in there making their own maps from another games, well its none of my business, but they didnt say much about copyright issues.

"Despite liking football I have no interest, weeks after the world cup ends, in having most of the top stories in the Bong sports app still banging on about the world cup (the ""World Cup News"" and ""World Cup Analysis"" tiles).  I cannot remove them from favourite sports, as the world cup doesn't appear in my favourite sports. I don't want to remove football as I want to follow the sport in general.

Unfortunately the problem is not with teams (I have Liverpool and Greenock Morton pinned but neither of those has much chance of appearing in a world cup finals tournament).  The problem is not with order, either, and I read the FAQ, as mentioned.  The problem is that the top stories category (which I wouldn't get rid of if I could!) contains two sub-categories full of tiles about the world cup, and there is no method documented in the FAQ for how to get rid of these.  Clicking and holding gives no actions, dragging merely selects; swiping up from the bottom of the screen offers no way to remove these sub-categories.  Basically, it seems to be some black box.

When using Bing Maps (which I use a lot), and I right-click on a location on the map, the pop up window that gives you the options 'Directions from here', 'Directions to here', 'Add a pushpin', etc., shows only briefly and then disappears before I can make a selection.  I tried it in Internet Explorer 11 and it works fine.  I haven't changed anything on the computer, no new downloaded programs, no nothing.

When I start my computer the Bing Search page opens despite having it set to open at the Start Page or the Desktop.  I purchased my Windows 8.1 computer this February and this has only recently become a problem.  This is an annoyance as I don't want to make a search every time I turn on my system.  If I right click the task bar and select the desktop properties menu a change to the start up settings stops the Bing search page opening for a while but then it reappears without any changes to settings being made.  This is so annoying that I have tried to remove Bing Search but even that has failed to stop this page reappearing.  I would be grateful for any help or to hear from other users with the same problem. ,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"First, I want to say thank you for taking the time to respond to my dilemma here.  I followed all of your instructions, and the app is still not working. I should mention that it was a very clean uninstall, and there was no leftover registry data or folders. I searched for them as you instructed, but there was nothing there, even with hidden folders unhidden.   I also checked the Bing Bar (I don't use it, but I figured I'd check it) and it has the same problem as Bing Desktop: it's visible, but none of the pulldown menus or icons do anything except become highlighted after I press them.

"Hi Max,   Thanks for getting back!   I understand that you want to refresh the data in your Bing Finance App. You mentioned that the data showing for ORCL ticker is still for NASDAQ instead of NYSE. I tried to follow the same steps to add it on the watchlist and I was able to add ORCL under NYSE successfully. It might be that an update for your Bing Finance App is needed to fix this. Let’s try the steps below.   Cleanup watchlist: 1.       Tap or click the pencil symbol on the upper right corner of your Watchlist page 2.       Tap (x) symbol to remove list. 3.       Once the Watchlist is empty close your Bing Finance then re-launch. 4.       Try to re-add ORCL to NYSE   Another thing is to check for possible updates on your computer for Bing Finance. We had rolled out major set of updates to the app that makes it easy to customize to suit your needs. Please check this link for further details.   NOTE: Performing these steps might remove your current watchlist but you can certainly add all of it after reinstalling.   If the issue still persists, uninstall and reinstall the app: 1.       Right-click on the app and click on uninstall.  2.       Click on the store then reload the app.    After performing the steps above you should be able to see the ORCL ticker for NYSE.   Let us know if this works. Thank you for using Bing.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

" I would first advise you to clear your browser's cache of temporary internet files and cookies. Each of the three major browsers (Chrome, FireFox and Internet Explorer) starts this procedure with Ctrl+Shift+Delete and then there may be some options you wish to engage that will be individual to the browser in question. One of these will be to clear the cookies and you will need to turn that on.  A word of caution; when clearing your cookies you may also clear log-ion information to some sites you visit requiring usernames and passwords. Make sure that you know your usernames and passwords for each of these sites before you clear your cookies as you may be asked to reenter the information on a subsequent visit.

I lost bing on windows 8 I can not fine on search  I can not find in c drive windows or my programs I can not find a way redownload a new bing win 8 help . it is at app store on laptop,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"It sounds like you're referring to the Bing app that appears by default on the Windows 8 Start screen, correct? It's possible that the app was just unpinned from your Start screen. The first thing you might try is to right-click on the Start screen or swipe up from the bottom of the screen and click the All Apps view. Here you should see a comprehensive list of all apps installed on your device. If you find Bing here, then you can just tap+hold to pin it to the Start screen again.  It's also possible that the app was accidentally uninstalled. Bing is a Windows Store (Metro) app,  not a conventional Windows program, so it cannot be managed through the Control Panel. Instead, you should check the Windows Store. Just open the Store app, search for Bing, and it will tell you whether or not it's already installed on your device. If not, you should be able to reinstall it from there. It's a free app, so that should take care of it.  If you're using the Windows 8.1 Preview (or the RTM), be advised that the Bing app no longer exists in this release. The Bing app will not appear in the Windows 8.1 Store. Instead, Bing has been integrated directly into the Search hero, which is accessible from the Search charm on the Charms bar. When you swipe from the right side of the screen (or press Win key + C), tap Search, and enter a search term while searching everywhere, your results will automatically incorporate results from Bing. There's no longer a need for a separate app.  Of course if you prefer a classic search experience, you can still pin the Bing web page to the Start Screen. Just open IE, go to www.bing.com, tap Favorites, and then tap Pin to Start. You'll get a big yellow live tile that just launches the site, shows trending topics, and basically functions like the aforementioned app.  And other tools, such as the Bing Desktop, can still be installed on the Windows 8.1 desktop.  Please let us know if that solves your issue. Thanks!","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

"Hello Patricia,  It seems that you are having an issue connecting your Facebook account to the Bing Bar due to script errors and there is no option to allow connection of Bing to Facebook.

Also, if you are referring to the “Allow” button, please be advised that clicking on the “Okay” button is as good as allowing Bing connection to Facebook.  Let me walk you through on how you can connect your Facebook account to the Bing Bar even if you encounter script error messages:  1) Sign in with your Facebook account in the Bing Bar.  2) When the ""Bing would like to access your email address, messages and friend requests"" dialog appears and a Script error that says ""An error has occurred in the script on this page"" overlaps the dialog, click on ""No"" button to stop running that script.  3) Click ""Okay"" button to proceed.  4) The page stating ""Bing would like to post to your friends on your behalf"" will appear next. Again, click ""No"" and then the ""Okay"" buttons to proceed.  5) The following page will appear next, ""Bing would like to manage your messages and manage your notifications."" Like the previous steps, you must stop running the script on the page by clicking the ""No"" button. Click ""Okay"" to proceed.

"Okay, please understand, I am not trying to give anyone a hard time.  However I have a lot of experience with software and PC's and I sincerely believe that most people & companies have forgotten the main primary reason for the development of personal computers to begin with and that was for the purpose of improving efficiency in doing day to day things.  IF this does not apply to you, then PLEASE direct it to someone who does have responsibility for this area and let's get this addressed and corrected to improve efficiency.  Is that acceptable.  The situation is that in the beginning, we, the clients came to Bing and searched out images.  Among those images, we the clients wanted to save some of the images on our systems for many reasons, some legit, some not, but for now, lets through out the non-legitimate reasons for capturing/saving images from the net onto our computers. And so, once we entered the filters for the images and the search results were returned, we would scan all of the results and those we liked/wanted to keep, we simply could right click on the image, then click on ""save as"" and automatically, something would appear in the ""file name"" area which always began with ""th"" and then a series of numbers of alpha characters.  Now, yesterday, or last nght to be exact, I read your answer on how to get an auto name which is more involved as it requires more steps.  So, I came here today to see what can be done to get us back to where we were originally thus eliminating steps and making it easy, thus more efficient.  However, as I prepared this reply, to insure I was using the correct terms where needed, it has all changed again!  Here is what happened.   I went to BING.com.  In the search box, I entered ""waterfalls"" and hit the search button and then immediately received a page full of images of different waterfalls.  I went to one of them, and right clicked on it and the dialog box came up to save the image and there was a name in the ""file name"" box.  But, I tried it again, on a different picture and the same name was there.  I tried to follow the directions from yesterday which was to put the cursor on the picture and left click it.  Nothing. Nothing at all, period.  Apparently someone might be reading these exchanges and is doing something to make changes but now once again, I am lost.  Who at BING do we need to contact to request we get back to the original point whereby when images are shown in search results and we wish to save images all we have to do is right click on the image, the click on ""save as"" and something will automatically appear uniquely for each image in the file name box so all we then have to do is click on the ""save"" button and it is done?  How do we request this change for the purpose of efficiency and to whom do we make the request?  Lastly and again, please, I am not attempting to be a smart buy why when something like this is entered into the community isn't someone from BING reading these issues and deciding, ""Oh that belongs to the development group"" and then forwards it to that group so the actually experts are answering the issue while also addressing what can or cannot be done to make changes for the purposes of efficiency.  I sincerely do not mean to be harsh, hard, or a smart mouth person being mean.  I am a retired QC Engineer and thus spent a good portion of my life addressing problems from the standpoint of the cause and especially how to correct so it never happens again and in a very efficient manner.  If a person is making $50/hour working on fixing problems, you want the problem fixed as fast as possible but in a very efficient manner and in a manner that insures it does not have to be addressed again or you are not being efficient, correct?  So, lastly, who do we address regarding this problem to get it fixed (it should never have been changed from the way it was) so we the customers can save pictures/images from Bing without having to make 10 steps when it can be done in 2 or 3 steps?  Thank you for your consideration and time!","[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]"

In the first place, you may try to turn the Bing Search history off and then turn it back on. Check if this resolves the issue.  Furthermore, you can set the Internet Explorer Browser history with timestamps and check if that affects the Bing search history. Refer to the following steps:  a. Open Internet Explorer. b. Press CTRL + H. c. Search for a specific history entry by clicking the ""View by Date"" box at the top of the ""History"" sidebar and clicking ""Search History.""

For a long time the Bing History page showed the prior search history in three columns with square thumbnails of the page visited with the search term and site inside the square and no timestamp. Sometime in the last few weeks it started to show the history as a row, in text, with a timestamp to the right. Then as of yesterday, it started to show the three column square again. I tried turning off the history in the page, and turning it back on, but it is still showing the old square thumbnail view.  Is there a way to turn the other view back on?

Let me explain this by example: I currently have an application which allows a user to right-click on a highlighted term an send it to ""web search"" which by default until now has been Google.  When this is done, the user is transferred from the application's screen to a Google page and the highlighted term appears in the Google search bar automatically thus starting the search process..  Essentially, the result is as if one has used the following URL in the browser's address bar: www.google.com/?query=search%20term, in order to execute a web search for the term ""search term."" What I am trying to do is find the correct format for the preceding URL so that I can accomplish the same thing with Bing.  While I have been able to change the default search engine preference within the application, I am having trouble sending the search parameters to Bing in a way that will begin the search process.   I have tried the following URL format: www.bing.com/?query=search%20term, but it fails to insert the search term into Bing's search bar. Is there a format I can use for the Bing URL that will simultaneously take the user to Bing and place the search term in the Bing search bar so that the search begins automatically?

"Earlier today I tried to do a bing search from my IE. From what I see the page has changed from what I normally see and am used to using. I was searching for a online game I had just beat called Tentacle Wars: PM to see if any other version were made or created, while I found a previously created game the images page that opened was different. So then clicked on videos and found the same style of change. Normally when I opened a web search for images or videos I would see a page of pictures and if you picked one it would ""open"" and popup in which you could see a ""toolbar"" of the previous and next pictures as well as enlarge the current picture and run the pictures thru slideshow. The video page would have a list of videos from different websites and also preview of the video if you placed the cursor over the image and if you clicked a video it would open in the popup screen and could play, pause,  go full screen. Now when I did the search today it only allows redirects to the page that the picture or video is hosted on, as well as the search list that appears only shows a few images or videos before you must go to the next page. Not sure if this is something that I can switch back to or something that Bing has done and will be the current version. I used to use the destop version of AOL on my old computer, and now that AOL is a webpage based site I have used Bing since. Not too tech savy but I'd hate to have to switch to a new browser or search engine.  Whats the story?

"Follow up from Matthew A15:  Thank you for the reply Smity. My first question after I wrote my post was would anyone reading it understand the issue or what I was describing. After I read your reply I began to think of a better way to describe it.  I searched ""Bing Image search"" and found a picture of the ""popup screen"" I was mentioning, it can be viewed at:  http://cdn2.ubergizmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/bing-image-search.jpg . Now as I described the search page is in the background of the screen and the ""popup window that has the options like enlarge, play slideshow.  When I searched ""Bing Video search"" I found a picture of the search result page for video, view here:  http://www.liveside.net/wp-content/images/2013/09/Bing-Video-Search.jpg. Now with each of these videos you see small icons on each video that would allow you to view the preview of the video (short few seconds) or if the video had to be viewed on the hosts page. Also a picture of the popup from a video viewed here: http://www.sitepronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Bing-video-search-4.jpg . Now in this you could watch the video while still on bing without a redirect (unless the video was marked that it was a redirect).  This is what I am looking for that browser/settings. Currently if I wish to search image or video I get a new window redirects to another site as well as only being able to view 28 (4x7) images before needing to go to the next page (the old version would just keep added them to bottom of page as well as having suggestions for other searches that could match).

It's pretty clear though that my pages are still indexed and when a Bing user enters a search term that includes a page from my site as a result it is then stripped out before showing it. It's as if there is a filter just before displaying the results that my pages get edited out. Clearly Bing has an issue with the site but... I'm also sure that for some reason my site triggered an automated scan that now needs to be manually reset for my site to show again. Any thoughts?  Thanks very much.,"[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]"

"Hi Sarah  Thanks for the reply. I still think the behavior in Bing calculator is unexpected and should be fixed although I do recognize that there is a design choice to be made there. But in any case, both results should be consistent. The biggest problem however is that Bing calculator is not consistent within itself. Input in Bing calculator:  1/(10000000000000000000+1000000000000000000)  which gives the correct answer of:  9.09090909E-20  Copy and paste that value into Bing calculator and divide by 10  9.09090909E-20/10  and you run into the same issue as above.

I'm soooo sick of marketing BS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
whenever a search engine slows down it is because of the add ons the advertisers daily check your installed programs.   I found netcrawl adverts hidden amongst my programs and promptly removed it. I also found that <Edited Content> conduit hidden another time and promptly removed that as well.,"[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]"
